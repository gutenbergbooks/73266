CHAPTER <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
</h3>
<h4>THE EPIDEMIC OF MYSTERY.
</h4>

<p>“Isn’t this terrible, Henry? Where is it going to
end?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t what terrible?—and where is what going
end?”</p>

<p>“Why! Haven’t you read to-night’s paper?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Here it is; read that!” and handing her husband
the <cite>Evening Herald</cite> Mrs. Hartsilver indicated
with her finger a paragraph in the “stoppress”
headed: “Another Society Tragedy,” and stated
that a well-known baronet had been found shot
in his bedroom in circumstances of great mystery.</p>

<p>Certainly the series of tragedies which had taken
place during the past eight months in what is
called “Society,” had been most puzzling.</p>

<p>First, Lord Hope-Cooper, the fifth peer, held in
high esteem by all his friends and acquaintances,
owner of Cowrie Park in Perthshire, Leveden Hall
in Warwickshire, and one of the finest houses in
Grosvenor Square, had drowned himself in the
beautiful lake at Cowrie, apparently for no reason
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>and without leaving even a note of farewell for
Lady Hope-Cooper, with whom he was known to
be on the best of terms—&#8203;they had been married
eight years.</p>

<p>Then Viscount Molesley, a rich bachelor of three-and-twenty,
an owner of thoroughbreds and well-known
about town and in sporting circles, had been
found shot in his bedroom one morning, an automatic
pistol on the floor beside him, and in the
grate the ashes of some burnt papers; apparently
he had shot himself after receiving his morning
letters.</p>

<p>Following close upon these tragedies had come the
sudden death of the Honorable Vera Froissart, Lord
Froissart’s younger daughter, in mysterious circumstances.
She had been found dead in the drawing-room
in her father’s house in Queen Anne’s Gate,
and at the inquest the jury had returned a verdict
of “death due apparently to shock.” Then the death
of a rather notorious ex-Society woman, Madame
Leonora Vandervelt, who had been divorced by
three husbands—&#8203;she had thrown herself out of a
fourth-floor window at a fashionable West End
hotel. Then the death by poisoning of an extremely
prosperous stockbroker of middle-age, owner of
two financial journals. And after that four or
five more tragedies of the same nature, the victim
in nearly every case being a man or woman of high
social standing and large income.</p>

<p>“Exactly the way Molesley made away with himself,”
Henry Hartsilver observed dryly as he laid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>down the paper after reading the report of the discovery
of Sir Stephen Lethbridge’s body in his bedroom
at Abbey Hall in Cumberland.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“You may think me hard and unsympathetic, my
dear,” he went on, addressing his wife, “but these
people who make away with themselves leave me
cold. Such tragedies don’t excite my pity—&#8203;they
arouse in me only a feeling of contempt.”</p>

<p>He paused, then continued:</p>

<p>“Now, look at me. <em>You</em> know how I began life,
though I sometimes try to forget it, as I hope others
do. My parents were poor, and I received only a
moderate education; but I had grit and determination
and I won through. And look at me to-day.
All who know me look up to and respect me. I’m
a self-made man and not ashamed to own it, though
I don’t crow about it on the housetops as some of
these plebeians do. Though I come of the people, I
pride myself on being one of Nature’s gentlemen,
and what can you want more than that—&#8203;eh? We
can’t choose our parents, or I might have chosen
parents like yours, my dear—&#8203;blue blood through
and through. And that was one reason why I
married you. I think I have told you this before.
I made up my mind when I was still a lad that the
woman I made my wife should be a lady in the
true acceptation of that often misapplied word, and
the first time I met you—&#8203;you remember that day,
eh, my dear?—I recognized the type, and then and
there I decided that you were the lady for me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
He lay back in the big arm-chair, slipped his
thumbs into the armholes of his waistcoat, and
looked at his young wife with an expression of
extreme self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>“But, Henry,” she said, wincing, “what has all
that to do with this calamity? You forget that I
knew poor Stephen Lethbridge. Abbey Hall is
close to my old home, and Stephen and I were
children together. I can’t help feeling upset.”</p>

<p>“I understand that quite well, but the feeling is
one you ought to fight against, my dear Cora. A
man who deliberately commits suicide, no matter
what his social status may be, and no matter what
the reason or reasons may be which prompt him
to commit the rash act, is guilty of a grave wrong,
not to himself alone, but to the whole of the community.
Heaven knows I have had difficulties, almost
unsurmountable difficulties, to contend with in
my time, yet the bare thought of self-destruction
never entered my imagination.”</p>

<p>Henry Hartsilver had been married three years.
A common, self-centered person, endowed with exceptional
shrewdness and with considerable commercial
acumen, he had begun life as a jerry-builder
in a small country town. Then war with Germany
had been declared, and realizing at once what so
many failed to realize, namely that such a war must
last for years at least, Hartsilver had seized the
opportunity he saw spread out before him of amassing
money quickly and in large lump sums by securing
by divers means building contracts for our
Government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
Thus, long before the war ended, he found himself
a rich man. Then, anxious to gratify his second
ambition, he set to work to look about for a woman
of good social standing to become his wife; the
thought that any woman to whom he might propose
might decline the honor of marrying him did not
occur to him.</p>

<p>Consequently he was not surprised, nor did he
appreciate the honor conferred upon him, when
the only surviving daughter of a well-connected
country gentleman accepted his offer of marriage.
True, the war had reduced her already impoverished
father almost to penury, and in addition both her
brothers had been killed in action early in the war,
so that when she accepted him she felt that she
did not now much care what became of her. Her
mother had been dead many years, and her father
she literally worshipped. What she never admitted,
even to herself, though in her heart she knew it
to be the truth, was that by marrying Henry Hartsilver
she would be able to provide her father with
a comfortable income in his declining years. And
since his sons’ death he had aged very rapidly.</p>

<p>Hartsilver was now in his forty-sixth year, his
wife just seven-and-twenty. They had no children,
but that did not prevent Hartsilver’s everlasting
complaint to his wife that he considered himself
deeply aggrieved at the Government’s neglect in
failing to confer a title upon him.</p>

<p>“Just think, my dear,” he had said to her more
than once, “what you would feel like if I made
you ‘my lady!’ Shouldn’t we be able to crow it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>over our friends, eh? And to think of the sums
I gave to war charities! Well, we must live in
hope!”</p>

<p>Fortunately his wife’s tact, possibly also the
sense of humor which she possessed, prevented
her from becoming annoyed with him when he
spoke like that, and making the sarcastic rejoinder
which she sometimes longed to utter. Though she
could not accuse herself of having married him for
his money, that being the last thing she cared about,
she yet felt that she had in a way married him
under false pretenses, for certainly she knew that,
but for her anxiety to add to her father’s happiness
and comfort, this common, self-satisfied, and self-righteous
person was one of the last men she would
have linked herself to for life.</p>

<p>Presently he spoke again.</p>

<p>“You know, my dear Cora,” he said, linking his
fingers across his ample chest, “although of course,
it distresses me that you should grieve for this man
Lethbridge, yet I don’t quite appreciate your feeling
what I can only suppose is a sort of affection
for the fellow—&#8203;you, a married woman. Somehow it
seems—&#8203;it seems not quite the right thing. A woman,
when she marries, should have no thought for other
men, at least of all thoughts of a—&#8203;er—&#8203;friendly
nature. Now, consider for a moment, and tell me
if your better nature does not tell you so itself.”</p>

<p>Cora Hartsilver winced, but her husband did not
notice it. He did notice, however, when a moment
later she smiled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
“You seem amused, my dear,” he said dryly.
“May I ask what amuses you?”</p>

<p>“Oh nothing, Henry, nothing at all,” she answered
quickly, then bit her lip. “It was only something
I happened to think of just then.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then it was something. Then why say
it was ‘nothing?’ You should always be truthful,
Cora, always absolutely truthful, in even the smallest
matters. And what did you ‘happen to think of
just then?’”</p>

<p>“I can’t remember now. It’s gone. Anyway it
was nothing of consequence. May I have that
paper again, Henry?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” he answered, shrugging his shoulders.
Then, as he handed it to her, he said:</p>

<p>“Tell me what you know about Sir Stephen
Lethbridge. I know him only by name.”</p>

<p>“Well, I have not seen him for a year or two,”
she replied carelessly. “Indeed, I think not since
our marriage. He came to the wedding, if you
remember.”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember. But go on.”</p>

<p>“He was in the Gunners. He went out to
France in 1914, and was home on sick leave when
we were married. He used to be rather fond of
me, I believe.”</p>

<p>Henry’s mouth opened. He stared at his wife in
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Really, Cora—&#8203;—” he began, but she went on
without heeding him.</p>

<p>“I heard not so long ago that he had got into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>rather a bad set. Somebody told me that the
things he had seen out in France seemed to have
unsettled his brain—&#8203;I know that happened in other
cases too. But he was a man who would never,
I am quite sure, have done anything dishonorable.
Oh, I wish I knew,” she exclaimed, carried away
by a sudden emotion. “I do wish I knew what
made him kill himself!”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t worry about him, my dear Cora, if
I were you,” her husband remarked coldly. “Probably
he was mentally unsound, mad—&#8203;‘potty’ as
the boys say, Those scenes in the trenches must
have been extremely trying. And yet—&#8203;had I been
younger and able to join the colors—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>He stopped and stared. Cora, lying back on the
settee, was laughing hysterically.</p>

<p>Cora Hartsilver was preparing to go out next
morning, when she was told that “Miss Yootha
Hagerston would like to see her.”</p>

<p>“Oh, ask her to come up!” she exclaimed. “And
Jackson—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“If Mr. Hartsilver should come in while I am
out, he had better be told that I shall not be in
for lunch.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>Jackson, the maid, went downstairs with a look
of mild amusement in her eyes. She had been in
the Hartsilvers’ service two years, and was fond
of expressing her opinion to the other servants on
the subject of what she called her master and
mistress’s “matrimonial <i lang="fr">mésalliance</i>.”</p>

<p>“I give them another year,” she had observed to
the cook only the night before, “and that will see
the end of it. However a lady like her came to
marry that—&#8203;that old woman of a husband of hers
fair beats me.”</p>

<p>“Not so much of the ‘old woman,’” the cook
had answered sharply—&#8203;she showed signs of age herself.
“But I do agree with you, Mary, nevertheless.
Ah, well, the old feller’s got the money-bags,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>and that goes a long way when it comes to marryin’,
I always says. I never did hold with these
love and cottage matches, nor I never shall. I’ve
had some of it, I can tell you, and I have told you
before now, but seein’ as my poor old man lies in
Carlisle churchyard, <i lang="la">nil nisi bonus</i>. Isn’t that how
they put it? And he had his good points for all
he was poor as a rat, that I will admit.”</p>

<p>Yootha Hagerston was one of Cora’s oldest and
dearest friends, the one friend, indeed, of whom she
had for years made an intimate confidant. Yootha
was not married, but that was not due to any lack
of suitors, for the proposals she had had were
numerous. She was a very pretty girl, about two
years younger than Cora: tall, slim, extremely
graceful, and with a face full of expression. She
was one of those girls who attract through their
personality rather than by the beauty of their
features. The look in the large intelligent eyes
betrayed her temperamental nature. She lived alone
in an unpretentious flat near Knightsbridge, which
she had taken two years before, after leaving her
home near Penrith owing, as she put it, to the
“impossible sort of life my people expected me to
lead, boxed up in the country and with nothing on
earth to do.” The truth was that her stepmother
disliked her, and that her father was intemperate.
Yootha was the youngest of three children; her
two brothers were serving oversea.</p>

<p>When she entered Cora’s bedroom, Cora came
forward and kissed her fondly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
“You dear thing,” she exclaimed. “I am so glad
you have come. I have not seen you for a week.
Where in the world have you been?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my people have been in town. You know
what that means.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I don’t! Your people? You mean your
father and mother?”</p>

<p>“Stepmother, if you please,” Yootha corrected.
“For goodness’ sake don’t insult my mother’s
memory. Yes, they both came up unexpectedly,
and for what do you think?”</p>

<p>“I give it up.”</p>

<p>“To try to persuade me to go home!” and Yootha
laughed merrily. “Can you see me back in the
old homestead with its memories of my happy
childhood’s days, and by contrast the atmosphere
which prevails there now? No, thank you! And
why do you think they wanted me back again,
Cora?”</p>

<p>“Oh, stop asking conundrums.”</p>

<p>“Because some busybody has been telling my
father that the way I live in my bachelor flat is
not <i lang="fr">comme il faut</i>, if you please, and so he thinks—&#8203;or
says he thinks—&#8203;that I may end by bringing the
family name into disrepute. Just think of that!
Now, if you ask me, I will tell you what I believe
the true reason is. On my twenty-fifth birthday
I come into some money from a defunct aunt, my
father’s only sister—&#8203;quite a nice little sum safely
invested—&#8203;and I am pretty sure my stepmother hopes
to induce me to make over a portion of the nest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>egg to her, or to my father. You have no idea
how amiable she was, and my father too. Couldn’t
make enough of me or do too much for me. The
money comes to me in five months’ time.”</p>

<p>“But didn’t they know before that you would
inherit it?”</p>

<p>“Apparently not. I knew nothing about it myself
until a few weeks ago, and I purposely didn’t
tell you then because the lawyer who wrote to me—&#8203;he
is a friend of mine—&#8203;asked me to say nothing
about it just yet. He told me about it more or
less in confidence—&#8203;said he thought I might like to
know.”</p>

<p>“So you are not going back to Cumberland?”</p>

<p>“My darling Cora, what a question!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am glad!” Mrs. Hartsilver exclaimed.
“I don’t know how I should live if you went away.
You are the only friend I have; you are, really.
Tell me, did your father or mother—&#8203;I beg your
pardon ‘stepmother’—say anything about Stephen
Lethbridge? You have read about the tragedy, of
course.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I have, and I at once thought of you.
Yes, they were full of it last night. My father
said he saw Stephen less than ten days ago, and
was struck by the change that had come over him.”</p>

<p>“How—&#8203;‘change’?”</p>

<p>“He said he looked years older than when he
saw him a month ago, and he mentioned the fact
to my stepmother at the time. Then he said that
strange-looking people had been staying at Abbey
Hall lately.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>“Men or women?”</p>

<p>“Men. There were rumors, too, my father said,
that Stephen had become financially embarrassed.”</p>

<p>“Really? But he was so well off, or supposed to
be.”</p>

<p>“I know. That adds to the mystery. I suppose
there was a woman, or women, in the case. I see
in to-day’s paper that an inquest will be held.”</p>

<p>Cora did not answer. She was staring out of
the window towards Regent’s Park—&#8203;the house was
in Park Crescent—&#8203;with troubled eyes, as though her
thoughts were miles away.</p>

<p>“Don’t fret, Cora,” her friend said at last. “I
know you were fond of him, and that he was fond
of you, but—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t, don’t speak like that,” Mrs. Hartsilver
exclaimed hastily, pressing her fingers to her
eyes. “It is all too terrible, I can’t bear to think
of it; and yet I can’t help thinking about it and
wondering—&#8203;wondering—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>Yootha Hagerston encircled her friend with her
arm, and kissed her warmly.</p>

<p>“I know—&#8203;I know,” she said in a tone of deep
sympathy. “No, we won’t talk about it. Did
Henry refer to it at all?”</p>

<p>“Henry!”</p>

<p>The tone betrayed utter contempt, almost hatred.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Henry referred to it all right. At least
I drew his attention to the report in last night’s
paper, and—&#8203;oh, you should have heard him! I
felt I wanted to scream. I longed to strike him.
He has no heart, Yootha, no sympathy for anything
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>or any one. I wonder sometimes why I go on living
with him. He said he felt only contempt for any
man who took his life, no matter in what circumstances!”</p>

<p>Like many another, Henry Hartsilver had succeeded
in supplying himself with petrol during the
war, and as his limousine sped slowly down Bond
Street a little later that morning with his wife and
Yootha Hagerston in it, officers home on leave
who noticed it wondered if people at home actually
realized what was happening on the Western front.</p>

<p>“More profiteers’ belongings!” a captain in the
Devons, limping painfully out of Clifford Street,
observed grimly. “I sometimes wish the Boches
could land a few thousand troops here to give our
folk a taste of the real thing. Who’s that they are
talking to? I seem to know his face.”</p>

<p>For the car, after slowing down, had stopped
owing to the traffic congestion, and a tall, good
looking, well-groomed man who could not have been
more than seven-and-twenty, had raised his hat
to its occupants and now stood on the curb, talking
to them.</p>

<p>“Know him!” the officer’s companion answered;
he was a gray-haired man who looked as if he had
been a sportsman. “Probably you do know him—&#8203;I
wonder who doesn’t. It’s Archie La Planta, one
of the most popular men in town, some say because
he’s so handsome, but I expect it’s largely
because he is such a good matrimonial catch.”</p>

<p>“Why isn’t he serving?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
“Oh, ask me another, Charlie. Why are half the
youths one meets not serving? They’ve managed
to wangle it somehow. Haven’t you ever met him?”</p>

<p>“Not to the best of my recollection. You see,
I’ve been in France three years. But I am sure I
have seen him somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Here he comes. I’ll introduce you. He knows
everybody worth knowing, and is quite an interesting
lad.”</p>

<p>La Planta was about to cross the street, when
he caught sight of his friend on the pavement,
hesitated an instant, then waited for his friend and
the wounded officer to come up.</p>

<p>“’Morning, Archie,” the man exclaimed who had
told Captain Preston who La Planta was. “Preston,
let me introduce Mr. La Planta.”</p>

<p>The two men bowed formally to each other.</p>

<p>“Archie, who are those two ladies to whom you
were talking, if you don’t mind my asking?” his
friend said a moment later.</p>

<p>La Planta told him.</p>

<p>“You must have heard of Henry Hartsilver,”
he added. “You won’t find a list of contributors
to any public war charity in which his name doesn’t
appear—&#8203;mind, I emphasize the <em>public</em>. Mrs. Hartsilver
is his wife, a charming woman.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that bounder,” the first speaker observed.
“Yes, I know all about him; one of our profiteers!”</p>

<p>“Exactly, and a quite impossible person in addition.
Which way are you going?”</p>

<p>The three progressed slowly, owing to Preston’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>limp, along the pavement, in the direction of Piccadilly.
Preston hardly spoke. He was almost
morose. The reason was that La Planta’s personality
repelled him. Why it repelled him he could
not explain. It was one of those natural repulsions
which all of us have experienced regarding certain
persons, and that we are at a loss to account for.</p>

<p>“Where are you both lunching?” La Planta asked
as they approached Piccadilly.</p>

<p>“Nowhere in particular,” Preston’s companion,
whose name was Blenkiron, replied.</p>

<p>“Well, why not lunch with me at the Ritz, and
I’ll introduce you to Mrs. Hartsilver and her friend.
They have promised to meet me there at one o’clock.
It is about the only place where one can get anything
decent to eat. You will find both ladies charming.”</p>

<p>It was then noon, and La Planta, saying that
he had an appointment at his club, left them after
arranging that they should all meet at the Ritz
at one.</p>

<p>“I am not attracted by the fellow,” Captain Preston
remarked some moments later. “I would sooner
have lunched with you alone, George. Who and
what is he?”</p>

<p>Blenkiron shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“What he is, we know—&#8203;a man of leisure and
of fortune. Who he is, whence he comes...?”</p>

<p>He made an expressive gesture.</p>

<p>“And, after all, what does it matter? Who
knows who half the people are whom one meets
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>everywhere to-day? They can afford to do you
well, they do do you well, and that is all that most
people care about. Though ‘La Planta’ is not precisely
a British name, the man looks, and evidently
is an Englishman. He has a great friend, indeed,
two great friends, who are almost always with him.
Profane people have nicknamed the three ‘The
Trinity.’ One is a man called Aloysius Stapleton,
the other is a young widow—&#8203;Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson,
a perfectly lovely creature; heaven knows what
her dressmaking bills must come to.”</p>

<p>“Or who pays them?”</p>

<p>“Charlie, that is unkind of you, what the women
call ‘catty.’ Why should we conclude that she
doesn’t pay her own bills?”</p>

<p>“And why should we conclude that she does?
Well, I shall be interested to meet Mrs. Hartsilver
at lunch presently. I don’t think I have ever before
met the wife of a profiteer.”</p>

<p>In spite of the Food Comptroller’s regulations, the
luncheon supplied at the Ritz lacked little. It was
the second day of our great offensive, August 9th,
1918, but a stranger looking about him in the
famous dining-room, where everybody seemed to be
in the best of spirits and spending money lavishly,
might have found it difficult to believe that men
were being shot down, mangled, tortured, and blown
to pieces in their thousands less than two hundred
miles away. Captain Preston thought of it, and of
the striking contrast, for that morning he had, while
at the War Office, listened on the telephone to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>great bombardment in progress. And that perhaps
was the reason he looked glum, and why he was, as
Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson afterwards remarked to
La Planta as they drove away together, “a regular
wet blanket right through the whole of lunch.”</p>

<p>Aloysius Stapleton, though not distinguished-looking,
was one of those men who, directly they begin
to talk, rivet the attention of their hearers. Forty-two
years of age, he did not look a day over thirty-five,
and in addition to being an excellent conversationalist,
his knowledge of men and women was
exceptional. He had traveled several times round
the world, or rather, as he put it, zig-zagged over
it more than once. He appeared to possess friends,
or at least acquaintances, in every capital in Europe,
also in many American cities and in far-off China
and Japan. The only country he had not visited,
he observed that day at lunch, was New Guinea,
but he meant to go there some day to complete
his education.</p>

<p>“Were you ever in Shanghai?” Preston inquired
carelessly, looking him straight in the eyes across
the table. As this was only the second time Preston
had spoken since they had sat down to lunch, everybody
looked towards him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Stapleton answered, meeting his gaze. “I
was there twice, some years before the war.”</p>

<p>“I stayed there several months in 1911,” Preston
said, “and I believe I met you there. Your face
seemed familiar to me when I was introduced to
you just now—&#8203;—” he was about to add that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>had just remembered it was in Shanghai he had
seen La Planta before, but he checked himself.</p>

<p>“Were you there in the autumn, and did you
stay at the Astor Hotel?” Stapleton asked.</p>

<p>“I did, and in the autumn.”</p>

<p>“Then no doubt we did meet, though I can’t at
the moment recollect the occasion.”</p>

<p>For a couple of seconds the two men looked hard
at each other. It was rather a curious look, as
though each were trying to read the other’s character.
The conversation was changed by Mrs.
Mervyn-Robertson’s saying suddenly:</p>

<p>“What is everybody going to do after lunch, I
wonder?”</p>

<p>And then, as nobody seemed to have any fixed
plans, she went on:</p>

<p>“Why don’t you all come to a little party I am
giving? Just a few intimate friends. We shall play
bridge, and several well-known artists will come
in later and have promised to sing. It would be
nice of you if you would all come.”</p>

<p>There was a strange expression, partly cynical
and partly of contempt, in Captain Preston’s gray
eyes as Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson stopped speaking.
The sound of the terrific slaughter which he had
listened to an hour or two before, and which must
be in progress still, he reflected, rang again in his
ears. And here in London, in the London which,
but for the heroism of our troops and their allies,
and the unflagging watchfulness of the nations’
navies, might already have been running in blood,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>these people, especially Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson
and her friends Stapleton and La Planta, seemed
to have no thought except for amusement and for
themselves.</p>

<p>“Good heavens,” he muttered, as presently they
all rose from the table. “I wish the Boches could
get here just to show them all what war and its
atrocities are like! Well, perhaps they may get
here yet.”</p>

<p>The only member of the party who had really
interested him had been Cora Hartsilver, and that
was due perhaps to the fact that La Planta had
told him that she had lost her brothers in the war.
Yootha Hagerston, too, he had rather liked; the
“atmosphere” surrounding both these women was
quite different he at once realized, from the “atmosphere”
of Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson and the men who,
so Blenkiron had told him, were her particular
friends.</p>

<p>And yet, before he had been long in Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson’s
beautifully appointed house in Cavendish
Square, its luxury and the sense of ease and
comfort the whole of her entourage exhaled began
to have its effect upon him. He was not a card-player,
but music at all times appealed to him intensely,
and as he lay back among the cushions in a
great soft arm-chair which Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson
had specially prepared for him, and listened with
rapt attention to Tchaikowsky’s wonderful “None
but the Weary Heart,” sung with violin obligato,
those thoughts of the horrors he had witnessed “out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>there,” which so perpetually haunted him, faded
completely from his mind, and even the dull, throbbing
pain in his injured leg became for the time
forgotten.</p>

<p>At last the music ceased, and he became conscious
of conversation in subdued tones at his elbow. The
speakers were late arrivals, and as he caught the
name “Hartsilver” his attention became focused on
what was being said.</p>

<p>“A terrible affair—&#8203;and his wife over there, talking,
knows nothing about it as yet.”</p>

<p>“When did it happen?”</p>

<p>“About midday. It must have been premeditated,
because when he was found dead in his bath
he had opened an artery with a razor.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></h3>
<h4>THE HIDDEN SCANDAL.
</h4>
</div>

<p>During the nine months which had passed since
Henry Hartsilver had been found dead in his bath,
many things had happened. The war was over,
and people were already beginning to forget the
discomfort, for some the misery, of those five long
years. In London the wheels of life, their spoke
having been removed, were slowly beginning to revolve
once more.</p>

<p>The thousands who had “done their bit,” and
become impoverished in consequence, were many
of them cursing the impetuosity which had led them
to forget their own interests in their anxiety to help
to avenge the outrages in Belgium and France, and
to save their own country from possible disaster.
On the other hand many thousands of men and
women who before the war had been struggling
small traders, now contemplated with a feeling of
smug satisfaction their swollen bank balances, and,
while thanking heaven there had been a war, began
to adopt a style of living which, though it ill became
them, gratified their vanity enormously.</p>

<p>“I ’aven’t reelly decided if me boy shall go to
Eton or to ’Arrow,” was the observation Captain
Preston had overheard while inspecting cars at the
motor exhibition one afternoon in late April, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>the remark had made him metaphorically grind his
teeth. For he detested the war profiteers as a race
almost as deeply as he hated “conscientious” objectors.
Indeed, since the war had ended he had
regretted more than ever that the Huns had failed
to land here.</p>

<p>The London season was now beginning, and the
traffic congestion in the streets was admitted by all
to be greater than at any period before the war.
Enormous cars blocked the main thoroughfares,
sometimes for hours at a time, yet everywhere was
talk of poverty among people of education and of
culture, who a few years previously had been in
good circumstances. And among the many rich
people in the West End few now entertained more
lavishly than Aloysius Stapleton and the man who
seemed to be his shadow—&#8203;young Archie La Planta.</p>

<p>“Then you have decided that it shall be at the
Albert Hall,” Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson said as she
thoughtfully blew a cloud of smoke towards the
ceiling, “and you want me to act as hostess? Well,
I won’t.”</p>

<p>“You won’t? But why not?”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t do, Louie,” she answered with decision,
addressing Aloysius Stapleton, who, seated
near her on a settee in the drawing-room in her
house in Cavendish Square, had been discussing
arrangements for a great <i lang="fr">bal masqué</i>.</p>

<p>“I really can’t see why; can you, Archie?” and
he looked across at La Planta.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t,” Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>dryly, before La Planta could reply. “I think men
are the dullest things, I do really. Though our
many ‘friends’ profess always to be so fond of us,
and so pleased to see us, any number of the women
hate me, if the truth were known.”</p>

<p>“They are simply jealous.”</p>

<p>“It’s the same thing. I know the things they
have said about me, and that they say still. Or if
they don’t say them they imply them, which is
worse. No, I refuse to be your hostess; also I
consider you ought to get somebody of more importance,
some woman of established social standing,
of high rank, if you want the ball to be a big
success. There are plenty of people who do like
me, of course, but at least they know nothing about
me, who I am or where I come from, and though
that may not count with the majority of men and
women in our large circle of acquaintance, it counts
a good deal with some—&#8203;they become inquisitive
after a time and start making inquiries in all sorts
of directions. Mrs. Hartsilver and her friend Yootha
Hagerston are making inquiries of that sort now. Do
you know that they have gone so far as to instruct
a personal inquiry agency to find out all about me?”</p>

<p>“I did hear something of the sort,” Stapleton said.
“But why worry? There is nothing it can say against
you.”</p>

<p>“You mean the agency?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“But it can invent things, and readily will if it
thinks it worth while.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
“Lies can’t be proved to be truth,” La Planta
said, who for some moments had not spoken.</p>

<p>“Indeed!” Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson exclaimed
with a little laugh. “Perhaps when you grow older
you will change your opinion,” she added. “You
are more ingenuous than I thought you were,
Archie!”</p>

<p>There were several visitors present, and soon
conversation drifted to other topics. After a little
while, however, somebody inquired, turning to Mrs.
Mervyn-Robertson:</p>

<p>“You were speaking some minutes ago of Mrs.
Hartsilver. Was anything ever discovered about
her husband—&#8203;I mean, why he put an end to himself?”</p>

<p>“I believe nothing. If anything had been discovered
I should probably have heard, as I know
many people who were friends of his. A verdict of
‘suicide while temporarily insane’ was returned at
the inquest, if you remember.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the woman who had inquired said thoughtfully.
“Yet he was one of the last men one would
have looked upon as insane. I should have called
him absolutely ‘all there.’”</p>

<p>“You never know,” Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson replied,
pouring out a cup of tea. “People one considers
sane seem nowadays to go mad in the most
astonishing way. Look at the terrible list of suicides
during the last year of the war, beginning
with Lord Hope-Cooper and Viscount Molesley. Of
course Madame Leonora Vandervelt’s tragedy was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>not so surprising—&#8203;she had had such a remarkable
career—&#8203;but poor Vera Froissart’s suicide gave us all
a terrible shock.”</p>

<p>“You knew her intimately, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“My dear, she was one of my closest friends. And
the jury pretended that she had died of ‘shock!’
Girls of that age don’t die of shock. My belief is
that she had some private love affair and—&#8203;but
there, I must not say more.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I do. And my suspicion is not based
on supposition only. Soon after her death I heard
definite rumors, which emanated from trustworthy
sources.”</p>

<p>“How dreadful! I hope they didn’t reach her
father.”</p>

<p>“I hope so too. He looked dreadfully altered
when I met him the other day, but Vera’s sad end
no doubt accounts for that.”</p>

<p>A minute or two later the visitor with whom Mrs.
Mervyn-Robertson had been conversing rose to go.
Other visitors followed her example, among them
La Planta.</p>

<p>“I am dining to-night with Mrs. Hartsilver,” he
said carelessly as they shook hands.</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>A look of sudden interest had come into Mrs.
Mervyn-Robertson’s eyes.</p>

<p>“You will tell me if she says anything about me?”
she added hurriedly under her breath.</p>

<p>“Of course I will. Shall I see you to-morrow?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
“Do. I shall be shopping in Bond Street in the
morning. Why not meet me at Asprey’s at twelve?”</p>

<p>“I will. By the way, Captain Preston inquired
for you this morning, when I met him in Regent
Street.”</p>

<p>“Captain Preston?” Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson repeated
with a puzzled look. “Who is he? I seem
to remember the name.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you recollect my introducing him to you
about nine months ago? We all had lunch together
at the Ritz—&#8203;Louie was there, and Mrs. Hartsilver
and Yootha Hagerston, and afterwards we went on
to your house to play bridge and listen to music,
and so on.”</p>

<p>“Of course, now I remember perfectly. A deadly
dull person, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He had been badly wounded and was only just
out of hospital. You will find him less dull now,
I think.”</p>

<p>“Possibly, but I am not very anxious to renew
the acquaintanceship. He is one of the people one
prefers to drop.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t like to hear that,” La Planta answered
with a laugh. “It struck me he was greatly
attracted by you that day, but tried not to show
it.”</p>

<p>“Then don’t tell him,” Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson
said lightly. “Good-by then—&#8203;and twelve to-morrow
at Asprey’s.”</p>

<p>As Archie La Planta stepped into his car strange
thoughts came to him. They were thoughts which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>would have astonished most of his friends, though
not Stapleton or the friend whose house he had
just left.</p>

<p>At his chambers in the Albany he rang for his
servant.</p>

<p>“James, bring me some telegram forms,” he said
as the man entered. “And where is my ‘Who’s
Who’?”</p>

<p>For some minutes he studied a page in “Who’s
Who” carefully. Then, when James reëntered with
the forms, he said:</p>

<p>“And now I want ‘Debrett.’ Why don’t you leave
my books of reference where I always put them?”
he added sharply.</p>

<p>“Mr. Stapleton looked in this morning, sir,” the
man answered, “and wanted your ‘Who’s Who’
and ‘Debrett’ in a hurry, to refer to; said he hadn’t
time to go home, sir. So I let him have them and
he left them on the piano.”</p>

<p>For some moments La Planta sat at his escritoire
writing out two telegrams.</p>

<p>“Send these off at once, James,” he said to his
servant, who stood waiting at his elbow. “Both
are very important.”</p>

<p>Then, going over to the full-length mirror, he
carefully lit a cigar in front of it, set it going, and
stretched himself out in a long fauteuil with his
back to the French window.</p>

<p>He was soon deep in thought.</p>

<p>Suddenly his reverie was interrupted by the sound
of the door-bell ringing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
“Hullo, Preston!” he exclaimed, as a moment
later the footman announced the captain, who came
limping into the room. “This is a pleasant surprise.
Come and sit over here,” and he rolled an armchair
towards him.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” his visitor answered. “I hope I am
not intruding?”</p>

<p>He let himself slowly down into the big chair,
then laid his stick beside it on the carpet.</p>

<p>“I wanted to see you rather particularly, La
Planta,” he said, when they had exchanged one or
two commonplace remarks. “So I looked up your
address in the ‘Red Book’ and came along. I tried
to get you on the telephone, but the operator declared
she could get no reply.”</p>

<p>“She always does,” the young man answered
dryly. “I have been seated beside the telephone
at least half an hour and the bell has not even
tinkled.”</p>

<p>“So much the better, perhaps, as I have found
you in. Now, what I want to see you about is Mrs.
Mervyn-Robertson.”</p>

<p>“Yes? I was at her house less than an hour
ago.”</p>

<p>“Do you mind if I ask if you know much about
her—&#8203;who she is, where she comes from, and all
that sort of thing? Please don’t think me inquisitive.
You may think it cool of me to ask you this,
but I have a reason for wanting to know.”</p>

<p>“Naturally, or you wouldn’t ask,” La Planta replied
quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
“I believe she is a friend of yours.”</p>

<p>“I believe she is. Do you mind telling me, Preston,
the reason you need the information?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least. A friend of mine, Lord Froissart,
whose daughter died suddenly over a year
ago, tells me that his daughter was rather intimate
with Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson, but knew nothing
about her—&#8203;that is to say, who her parents were
and so on. His daughter’s death has rather preyed
upon his mind, and he seems to suffer under what
I take to be a delusion that Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson
could throw some light on the cause of death
if she chose. Consequently he has been worrying
a good deal about the lady, and, when I dined
with him last night, he asked me as a particular
favor—&#8203;I am an old friend of his—&#8203;if I would try
to interview you on the subject, and ask you to
tell me Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson’s past history, if you
know it. I said I would, though it is not a task I
greatly relish as I am sure you will understand.”</p>

<p>La Planta did not answer for some moments.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson was a great friend
of Vera Froissart,” he said at last, “and I don’t
suppose any of Vera’s friends was more upset at
her sudden death than Mrs. Robertson was. The
astonishing delusion you speak of—&#8203;Froissart’s apparent
belief that Mrs. Robertson has some knowledge
or suspicion of what brought about the tragedy—&#8203;is,
of course, the result of an unhinged mind.
As for my telling you Mrs. Robertson’s private
history, though I quite see how you are placed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>I consider that to go into a family affair of that
sort would, under existing conditions, be a breach
of confidence on my part. Also, what bearing
could such knowledge have on Mrs. Robertson’s
knowing why Vera Froissart ended her life, as she
undoubtedly did? Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson is a
friend whose acquaintance I made some years ago
under rather romantic circumstances, and to you I
don’t mind saying that she has made me her rather
close confidant. This I can tell you, however—&#8203;she
is a woman who has from first to last met with
many misfortunes, and been persistently misunderstood.”</p>

<p>For a minute both men were silent.</p>

<p>“And is that all you are prepared to tell me about
her?” Preston said suddenly, in rather a hard voice.</p>

<p>“That is all.”</p>

<p>“In that case, La Planta,” Preston bent down
to get his stick, “perhaps I had better go.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you had.”</p>

<p>The wounded man looked up quickly, as though
something in the young man’s tone had stung him,
and their eyes met. It was little more than a
glance which passed between them, yet the swift
transference of thought from each to the other
warned Preston to be on his guard against this
polite, suave youth who was popularly said to be
the most sought after bachelor in London; and
in the same way La Planta knew on the instant
that before him stood a man who might, under
certain conditions, prove a formidable adversary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
“Good afternoon,” Captain Preston said, as he
put on his hat in the hall.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” La Planta replied with frigid
courtesy.</p>

<p>Then James, who had returned from the telegraph
office, opened the door and the captain limped
slowly up the Albany towards Vigo Street.</p>

<p>By the time Preston reached Regent Street, Archie
La Planta had succeeded in getting through on the
telephone to Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson, and was telling
her what had just occurred. When he stopped
speaking, he heard her give a gay little laugh.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I say this afternoon,” she exclaimed,
“that he was one of the people whose acquaintance
I preferred to drop?”</p>

CHAPTER <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>
</h3>
<h4>THE BRONZE FACE.
</h4>
</div>

<p>Though Archie La Planta had met Cora Hartsilver
frequently since the Armistice, he did not
know her intimately, and had therefore been rather
surprised at her asking him to dine. He concluded
that she must be giving a dinner party, so when
on the evening Preston had called to see him, he
arrived at the big house in Park Crescent, he was
astonished to find that Yootha Hagerston was to be
the only other guest. Then and there his quick
brain began to act and, while carrying on light
conversation with the two ladies, he kept asking himself
what reason Mrs. Hartsilver could have had for
inviting him.</p>

<p>She had an excellent cook who had been with her
since her marriage, and the little dinner was irreproachable.
La Planta, an epicure to his fingertips,
had realized this at once, and towards the end of
the meal he began to feel at peace with the world
at large.</p>

<p>“It is awfully good of you to have invited me to
a nice, friendly little dinner like this,” he remarked
presently, looking his hostess straight in the eyes
across the table. “I don’t like big dinner parties,
you know, and was half afraid you might have a
lot of people to-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
“I never give big dinner parties if I can help it,”
Cora answered, “though one has to sometimes. Like
you, I prefer an informal little gathering, just one
or two friends with whom one can exchange ideas.
So many people are colorless, don’t you find? And
dull people bore me to death. Let me pass you the
port.”</p>

<p>It was ’48 port which had belonged to her late
husband. La Planta poured himself out another
glass, and presently his gaze became fixed upon the
widow. It had never struck him before, he thought,
what a pretty woman she was.</p>

<p>“When are we going to see your charming friend
again?” Yootha presently said carelessly. “I do
think her so attractive.”</p>

<p>“Which charming friend is that?”</p>

<p>“Why, Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson, of course. Who
else could it be?”</p>

<p>At once La Planta was on the alert. The words
flashed back into his partly bemused brain: “Mrs.
Hartsilver and her friend Yootha Hagerston are
making inquiries about me now. Do you know that
they have gone so far as to instruct a personal inquiry
agency to find out all about me?”</p>

<p>Could that be the reason he had been invited to
dine? Were they going to try to find out from
him something about Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson,
though perhaps with greater tact than Preston had
displayed?</p>

<p>He pulled himself together, and answered:</p>

<p>“I am sure Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson would like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>to meet you at any time.” Then he added as an
afterthought: “Though she has many acquaintances,
she has comparatively few friends.”</p>

<p>“Do you think she would dine with me one
night if I invited her?” Mrs. Hartsilver asked
quickly. “We have met only casually.”</p>

<p>“I am sure she would. She is not one of those
people who stand always on ceremony. Like most
people who have traveled, she takes a broad view
of life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, has she traveled a lot?” Yootha asked.
“How interesting. Tell me—&#8203;where has she been?”</p>

<p>“Rather you should say, ‘Where has she not
been?’ She has been almost everywhere, I believe.”</p>

<p>“I do think she is lovely, don’t you?” Yootha
persisted. “If I were a man I should be head over
heels in love with her.”</p>

<p>“Some men are,” La Planta answered in an odd
tone. “But she doesn’t care about men, I think.
I mean in a general way.”</p>

<p>“Did you say she had been in China?” Yootha
suddenly asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t—&#8203;but she has been. She was in Shanghai
a good while.”</p>

<p>“She is a widow, I am told,” Cora presently
hazarded.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Did you know her husband?”</p>

<p>“No. He died several years ago.”</p>

<p>“But you have known her a good while?”</p>

<p>“Only a year or two.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
“Is she entirely English? I sometimes think—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“I was only going to say she sometimes gives
me the impression that she has a foreign strain.”</p>

<p>“If Australians are ‘foreigners,’” La Planta said
lightly, “then she has a ‘foreign’ strain, because her
parents were Australians—&#8203;they were sheep farmers
in Queensland.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so. That no doubt accounts for
the queer expressions she sometimes uses. They
were rich people, no doubt.”</p>

<p>“Well off, I fancy, but not enormously rich.”</p>

<p>“Then her fortune, I take it, came to her from
her husband?”</p>

<p>La Planta had been answering more or less
mechanically, for the wine he had drunk had dulled,
to some extent, his ordinarily keen intelligence.
Now, all at once, he seemed to become alive again.</p>

<p>“You seem greatly interested in Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson’s
private life, Mrs. Hartsilver, and you
too, Miss Hagerston,” he said suddenly. “Oddly
enough a man you know, in fact it was I who introduced
him to you, called to see me only an hour
ago for the express purpose of cross-questioning me
with regard to the same lady. Merely a coincidence
no doubt, but a singular coincidence.”</p>

<p>His tone, as he said this, resembled the tone he
had adopted whilst addressing Preston, though it
was not quite so marked. Mrs. Hartsilver and
Yootha Hagerston winced nevertheless, and presently
they changed the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
He joined them in the drawing-room about ten
minutes later, and half an hour or so afterwards
took his departure rather abruptly. Though he had
drunk more than was good for him, he knew he
had not said anything that he would wish to recall.
He walked leisurely down Portland Place in search
of a taxi, then decided to walk home.</p>

<p>In Regent Street, as he passed into the halo of
light shed down by a street lamp, he came face to
face with Stapleton.</p>

<p>“Why Archie,” the latter exclaimed, “I was just
thinking of you. Aren’t you dining with Mrs. Hartsilver?”</p>

<p>“I was,” La Planta answered, “but she and
Yootha Hagerston rather bored me, so I came away
early.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it a dinner party?”</p>

<p>“No, only those two.”</p>

<p>“Only the two! Then why were you invited?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but I think I can guess. Come
along home with me. There are one or two things
I want to talk to you about.”</p>

<p>At first Stapleton hesitated, alleging that he had
an appointment, but finally he decided to do as
his friend suggested.</p>

<p>Two telegrams lay awaiting La Planta in his
sitting-room, and after reading them he handed them
to Stapleton.</p>

<p>As Stapleton read the second, he raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Curious, isn’t it?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
“I think not. I expected as much.”</p>

<p>“Won’t it upset your calculations?”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily.”</p>

<p>A tantalus and syphons stood on the table. Without
saying more, Stapleton mixed himself a brandy
and soda. Then he took a cigar from La Planta’s
box.</p>

<p>“One or two things have happened lately,” he
said at last, “which rather puzzle me. And the
last is why those women should have asked you
to dine alone with them.”</p>

<p>“No puzzle about that,” Archie answered, then
went on to explain how Mrs. Hartsilver and Yootha
Hagerston had obviously tried to pick his brain
regarding Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson and her past life.</p>

<p>“Strange,” Stapleton said thoughtfully. “That
fits in with something that was said to me within
the last hour. You know that little Jew who lends
money to his friends—&#8203;Levi Schomberg?”</p>

<p>“By name.”</p>

<p>“I know him only slightly, but we walked along
Jermyn Street together just now—&#8203;he was bound for
the Turkish baths—&#8203;and he warned me to be on my
guard against ‘Hartsilver’s widow’—said she was a
‘designing woman,’ as I might presently find out, and
added that she was trying, for a reason which he
stated, to get a case up against—&#8203;well, you can guess
whom.”</p>

<p>“What sort of case?”</p>

<p>“A scandalous case. So, putting two and two
together, I can only suppose that Cora Hartsilver
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>is either jealous of our friend, or that for some
reason she bears her a grudge.”</p>

<p>For a little while they continued talking.</p>

<p>And, while they talked, interesting events were
in progress not far away.</p>

<p>“The house with the bronze face,” as it was
called by people living in the neighborhood, was
situated in a quiet street just off Russell Square.
It had acquired that curious appellation owing to
its front door being made conspicuous by a huge
old Florentine bronze knocker representing a
woman’s laughing face. The face was really that
of a bacchante, and a very wicked-looking bacchante
at that, and many were the stories told about the
house in consequence. Some said the woman’s face
possessed a lurid significance, and that within those
portals.... Another rumor often credited was that
the face could cast a spell over those who sought
to probe its history, and that on more than one
occasion persons who had entered the house had
never come out again.</p>

<p>Those were, of course, foolish legends, yet the
fact remained that an atmosphere of mystery surrounded
the house with the bronze face. Obviously
at some period it had been a private residence.
Now it was ostensibly the headquarters of a private
inquiry agency which had sprung into existence
shortly before the war, and was known to be
patronized by many fashionable and rich people.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight, and in a comfortably
furnished office in the middle of the building, so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>that no light showed in the street outside, a venerable-looking
old gentleman and a handsome young
woman, the latter with a semitic cast of countenance,
sat side by side examining some documents.</p>

<p>A shaded electric reading-lamp on the table gave
the only light in the room, and the documents lay
in the ray which it shed immediately in front of
them.</p>

<p>Neither spoke. Both were working rapidly. First
the old man would take a document off the pile,
read through it carefully, then pass it to his companion,
who, after quickly scanning its contents,
would make a marginal note or two, and then docket
it. Thus they continued in silence for over half
an hour, when the pile of papers came to an end.</p>

<p>The man leant back in his chair, stretched himself,
and yawned.</p>

<p>“We have had about enough of this, eh, Camille?”
he said, turning with a curious expression to his
companion.</p>

<p>“Not half!” she answered with a foreign accent,
which made the slang sound quaint. “<i lang="fr">Après
minuit</i>,” she added, glancing at her wrist-watch.
“I call it crewel.”</p>

<p>“Never mind; it can’t last,” he said. “Or at
least it won’t if I have much to do with it. Give
me one of your chipre cigarettes.”</p>

<p>She took a cigarette herself and lit it, then handed
him her case.</p>

<p>The room in some respects resembled a boudoir
rather than an office, but hung on its walls were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>charts marked with colored chalks. In all there
were eight of these charts, and below each was a
row of numerals. At one end of the room the
framed portrait of a dark man with curly hair
and a waxed mustache, a man obviously a foreigner,
stood on the overmantle. In a corner near by were
stacked twenty or more japanned tin boxes which
might have been deed boxes, though none bore any
name, while at the opposite end, close to the window,
were several luxurious fauteuils, a comfortable
settee, some occasional tables and Chippendale
chairs. No sound of any sort found its way into the
room.</p>

<p>The man rose in silence, and began slowly to
pace the floor. Suddenly he stopped.</p>

<p>“This case interests me a good deal, Camille,”
he said at last. “I feel sure she must have married
the man.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Naturellement</i>,” the woman answered with a
shrug. “And now she wish—&#8203;how you say—&#8203;to be
rids of him?”</p>

<p>“Rid of him, not ‘rids.’ But why?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Ma foi</i>, you ask me one more. He has much
money, <i lang="fr">hein</i>?”</p>

<p>“It would seem so, judging by the sums he
spends.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Alors naturellement.</i> What else?”</p>

<p>“But proofs of the marriage have to be obtained,
or she doesn’t get the money.”</p>

<p>“Oh, the proof can be obtained. I obtain him.”</p>

<p>“And what if—&#8203;—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
He stopped abruptly. Both looked quickly towards
the door. For some moments neither spoke.
No sound broke the perfect stillness.</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr">Qu’est-ce que ca?</i>” the woman asked in a nervous
undertone, putting her hand on his arm. Both were
still staring at the closed door.</p>

<p>“Wait, and I will see.”</p>

<p>He rose, but the woman clutched him.</p>

<p>“No, no,” she exclaimed hoarsely, “you must not
go out there!”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I must, and I am going.”</p>

<p>He tried to shake her off, but she only tightened
her hold.</p>

<p>“If you must—&#8203;here,” and as she spoke she produced
from under her skirt a small automatic pistol,
pressed forward the safety-bolt, and slipped the
weapon into his hand. Then she released him.</p>

<p>Noiselessly he stepped across the room on the
thick carpet, placed his hand carefully on the door
handle, turned it very slowly and gently drew open
the door.</p>

<p>As he did so a streak of light, as if from an electric
torch, shone into the room. The old man hurried
out on to the landing with wonderful agility, but
the light had vanished. He switched on the electric
lamp at the head of the stairs. Nowhere was anybody
visible.</p>

<p>Glancing quickly in every direction, and with
his finger on the trigger of the automatic, he crept
cautiously down the stairs. Presently the woman,
who had now ventured a little way down the stairs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>after him, heard him moving in the hall. Soon
she heard the spring baize door, which opened on
to a passage leading to the kitchen quarters, open
with a squeak, then shut with a dull thud.</p>

<p>For a minute she waited, hardly breathing. There
could be no doubt that somebody besides themselves
must be in the house. Yet how could anybody
have entered, seeing that since early in the
evening both front and back doors had been securely
bolted and locked?</p>

<p>She was trying to summon courage enough to
follow her companion, when a sound just behind
her made her turn with a cry of alarm.</p>

<h4>BEHIND THE DOOR.
</h4>
</div>

<p>A tall, slim man of aristocratic appearance, dressed
in a tweed suit and with his hat on, stood at the
head of the stairs. He had a walking-stick in his
right hand, in his left an extinct electric torch.</p>

<p>“I think you will remember me, Madame Lenoir,”
he said quietly.</p>

<p>The woman stared hard at him for a moment,
then a look of recognition spread over her face.</p>

<p>“Ha, Milord Froissart!” she exclaimed in a tone
of relief. “Ha, but you frightened me, you frighten
us both. But how did milord come in? And what
is it you want so late at night?”</p>

<p>“I want to see your partner, Alix Stothert. Why
has he gone downstairs?”</p>

<p>“To see who might be there, milord. We thought
we heard somebody in the house, so he go down to
search about. And it was only you? Then why
did you not say?”</p>

<p>“Because when he opened the door I saw a pistol
in his hand, so I thought he might shoot before he
recognized me. Listen, I hear him.”</p>

<p>The baize door in the hall had opened and shut
again, and Stothert now stood at the foot of the
stairs, looking up in amazement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
“Lord Froissart!” he exclaimed. “Well, of all the
wonders!”</p>

<p>He came quickly up the stairs, and a minute later
the two men and Camille Lenoir were together in
the room from which Stothert and his companion
had just emerged.</p>

<p>“This is a most perplexing thing,” Stothert said,
as he pushed a chair towards the ‘visitor.’ “I wish
you would tell me, first of all, how you got in, Lord
Froissart.”</p>

<p>“Certainly. I came to see you this afternoon
about six o’clock, and when I arrived at the house
I found the door open—&#8203;some workmen were attending
to your electric light in the hall. I walked in,
meaning to come up to your office, but I went a
floor too high, took a wrong turning off the landing,
and found myself in a passage along which I wandered
until I came to a door which I opened and
passed through, still trying to find your office. It
is a heavy mahogany door, and as I shut it behind
me the handle came off in my hand. While trying
to refit the handle I accidentally pushed the metal
stem through the socket in the door, and at
once I realized I was a prisoner, for the passage
led into a room from which there is no other
outlet.”</p>

<p>He paused a moment, and then continued:</p>

<p>“When I found it impossible to open the door
by any means, I hammered on it with my stick,
and shouted. In fact I made all the noise I could,
but apparently you didn’t hear me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
“Certainly we did not,” Stothert answered. “That
room is a long way off, and there are several doors
between it and the landing. How did you get out
eventually?”</p>

<p>Lord Froissart held out his walking stick.</p>

<p>“With the help of this,” he said. “In desperation
I finally set to work to grind the ferrule square
by rubbing it on the hearthstone in that room—&#8203;I
fear I have disfigured the stone, but that, of
course, I will make good. It was a long job, I
can assure you—&#8203;and it ruined my stick. Here,
take your torch,” he added with a laugh, as he
handed it to him.</p>

<p>Stothert and his companion looked considerably
relieved.</p>

<p>“A most unfortunate mishap,” the former remarked,
with a quick glance at the woman. “And
you gave us quite a fright,” he added. “We thought
burglars had broken in.”</p>

<p>“Well, I thought so too, for some minutes,”
Froissart said lightly. “Do you always work as
late as this, if it is not an impertinent question?”
He looked about the room. “I see you have been
hard at it.”</p>

<p>“No, we rarely work late, but to-night we had
on hand rather an urgent matter. And may I ask,
m’lord, what you wished to see me about when you
came here this afternoon? Oh, excuse me, you
surely must be hungry after your long imprisonment—&#8203;I
feel that indirectly I am to blame for the
mishap. Camille,” he turned to the woman, “go
and see if you can find something for Lord Froissart
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>to eat. I am afraid m’lord there is not much in
the house.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t trouble about food on my account,”
Froissart urged. “I really am not hungry, and
the blunder was my fault. And now, with regard
to the matter I wanted to see you about. You
remember, of course, the sad affair of my poor
daughter’s death?”</p>

<p>“Quite well. The papers were full of it, which
must have caused you pain.”</p>

<p>“It did—&#8203;great pain. It seems to me that the
newspapers have no consideration for people’s feelings—&#8203;they
have no delicacy, no mercy.”</p>

<p>“I fully agree with you.”</p>

<p>“Well now, in spite of the jury’s verdict that
my daughter died of shock, it must have been
patent to you, and I fear also to others, that the
poor child took her life. Why she should have
done so has puzzled me ever since, for I can think
no reason which might have prompted her to do
it. She had, however, a friend, I may say a great
friend, of whom it now appears that nobody knows
anything except that she is apparently a very well-to-do
woman. Strange rumors concerning her have
been repeated to me of late, and putting two and
two together, it seems to me possible that this friend
of hers might, if she wished to, be able to solve the
mystery. Now, why won’t she? Can you tell me
that?”</p>

<p>“Who is the woman, m’lord?” Stothert asked.
“Anything you tell us will, of course, be considered
private and confidential.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
“Yes, please consider this private. The woman
you will probably know. Her name is Mervyn-Robertson.”
Stothert and his companion exchanged
a meaning glance. “Ah, I see you do know her,”
Lord Froissart said quickly.</p>

<p>“Indeed we do, m’lord, that is to say, by name.
We know a lot about her.”</p>

<p>“And is what you know favorable, or is it—&#8203;er—&#8203;the
other thing?”</p>

<p>“Certainly ‘the other thing.’ More than that we
must not say. And so you wish us to find out who
and what she is, where she comes from, and so
forth?”</p>

<p>“If you can.”</p>

<p>“That will not be difficult. Already we can tell
you that her birthplace was Australia; also that
her parents were sheep farmers in Queensland.”</p>

<p>“Oh! That sounds quite respectable.”</p>

<p>“It sounds respectable, but....”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Things, you know, are not always what they
sound. Are you likely, m’lord, to attend the big
ball to be given at the Albert Hall on the twenty-ninth
of this month?”</p>

<p>“I had not heard of it. Who is giving the
ball?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Stapleton and Mr. La Planta, though I
believe they don’t themselves know who will act
as hostess. They are friends of Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson,
as you probably know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have heard of them, though I don’t know
them personally. I recollect we happened to speak
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>of them when I came here to consult you about my
poor daughter’s death. I hoped then that your
wide knowledge of what is happening privately
among well-known people soon might succeed in
throwing light on the cause of that terrible tragedy,
but unfortunately you were not able to do so. And
now tell me—&#8203;why do you wish to know if I am likely
to attend this ball? Surely you must know that I
never go out now?”</p>

<p>“It might be to your advantage, m’lord, to do
so on this occasion, though why it might be I must
not tell you yet. More, m’lord. I would, if I may,
urge you to attend it.”</p>

<p>“Of course if you think it will serve some good
purpose, Stothert.”</p>

<p>“I don’t merely think so, I am almost sure it
would. I believe it might indirectly help us in our
investigations concerning Miss Froissart’s strange
death.”</p>

<p>“In that case I certainly will go.”</p>

<p>“And you will advise us in advance of the costume
you will wear? Please don’t fail to do that. A
mask and fancy costume are to be obligatory, I
hear.”</p>

<p>When Lord Froissart had gone, Stothert and his
partner breathed more freely. It was true that
their “firm” calling itself the Metropolitan Secret
Agency, had obtained a wonderful reputation for
getting secret information about people’s private
lives, but rumors were rife regarding the methods
it employed to achieve its aim. Women of high
station, anxious to rid themselves of their husbands;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>husbands desiring to prove their wives’ alleged infidelity,
and many others, now almost invariably
went straight to the Metropolitan Secret Agency,
or “the house with the bronze face” as Society
people too had come to call it, and generally within
a week the Agency would put them in possession
of enough indisputable evidence to damn the suspected
party irrevocably and forever.</p>

<p>Certainly the amount the Agency knew about the
private lives and affairs of more than half the peerage
was astonishing. How they came by it all was
a problem which rival agencies tried in vain to
solve, and, having failed to solve it, some would
proceed to vent their spleen by spreading false
stories concerning the house with the bronze knocker,
its inmates, and the way the business carried on
there was conducted.</p>

<p>Not that either Stothert or his French partner
cared in the least what was said about them. As
the former was fond of remarking: “They can
say what they like about us, but they can’t prove
the truth of even a single statement.”</p>

<p>As Lord Froissart drove homeward in a taxi,
his thoughts became centered on the house with the
bronze face, and its strange tenants. The Metropolitan
Secret Agency had been in existence less than
three years, yet already it was looked upon as the
premier inquiry agency in London. Though it
never advertised, everybody in Society knew of its
existence, and the rapidity with which it supplied
information, which was invariably accurate, was
common talk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
Then, who were Stothert and his companion,
Madame Camille Lenoir? He had been told that
they had come to London together and started
their strange business without friends or introductions.
Had they other partners? And if so, who
were they? Madame Leonora Vandervelt, the beautiful
adventuress who had committed suicide by
throwing herself out of an hotel window, had
been convicted on each of the three occasions she
had appeared in the divorce court on evidence
supplied by the Metropolitan Secret Agency. Twice
the well-known Society woman, Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson,
had visited the house with the bronze
face with reference to thefts of some of her valuable
jewelry, and each time the thief had been caught
within a fortnight. Then her friend Stapleton
when his Fiat car was stolen while he was choosing
shirts at Wing’s in Piccadilly—&#8203;this fact mentioned
in Court created some amusement—&#8203;had gone direct
to Bloomsbury and interviewed Alix Stothert, with
the result that both car and thief had been traced
to Llandudno, and the thief arrested there while
actually in the car.</p>

<p>That and a dozen similar examples of the Metropolitan
Secret Agency’s amazing efficiency occurred
to him, and the more he thought about the Agency,
the more he marveled. Another question he asked
himself was why the Agency should have rented
that big house in Bloomsbury, seeing that their
offices in it occupied apparently no more than four
rooms, the rest of the house being in consequence
empty and waste space. When he had lost himself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>in the house that afternoon he must have wandered,
he reflected, into a dozen rooms or more, not one
of which was even furnished, though nearly all had
carpets. On the previous occasion when he had
visited the Agency, he had seen six or eight clerks
apparently hard at work, but the only people in
authority were Stothert and the rather common
Frenchwoman.</p>

<p>And the more he thought, the more puzzling the
problem seemed to be. Not the least astonishing
thing was that the partners should have found it
necessary to continue working so late at night after
probably working hard all day. He had, like most
people, heard rumors about the house, including
the story that people were seen to enter it who
never came out again, but to such legends he paid
no heed. He had just asked himself if it might not
be advisable to deal carefully with this man and
woman who treated him always with so much deference
and outward courtesy, when the taxi drew
up at his house in Queen Anne’s Gate.</p>

CHAPTER <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr>
</h3>
<h4>CORA HARTSILVER’S CONFESSION.
</h4>
</div>


<p>Though Yootha Hagerston had now inherited the
little fortune left to her by her aunt, she had
not thought it necessary to change her mode of
living, or even to move from her flat near Knightsbridge
into more expensive quarters, as one or two
of her snobbish-minded acquaintances had told her
they supposed she would do.</p>

<p>Of late she had, however, changed in some ways,
as many people had noticed. She seemed pensive,
at times quite <i lang="fr">distraite</i>, and this gave rise to various
conjectures among her many casual acquaintances.
By some it was hinted that “there must be a man
in the case,” though none could think who the man
could be, as Yootha was not by any means fond of
men’s society; on the contrary, she often freely
admitted that the conversation of most young men,
and even middle-aged men, bored her considerably.</p>

<p>“Yootha Hagerston will never marry—&#8203;mark my
words,” a woman who had known her “since she
was so high,” observed sententiously one day. She
lived in the neighborhood of Yootha’s home in
Cumberland with a crushed creature she called a
husband, and had always strongly disapproved of
what she called “the girl’s abominable independence”
in deserting the stagnation of her native village
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>to live her own life in London. “What is more,”
the woman used sometimes to add, “I should not
be a bit surprised if one day we heard some deplorable
story about her. It’s just what the
Bible says, ‘Bring up a child and away it do go,’
and the Bible speaks the truth every time, you
know.”</p>

<p>It was this futile person who had first hinted to
Yootha’s parents that it was not <i lang="fr">comme il faut</i> for
a daughter of theirs to live a bachelor life in London,
and it was on the strength of her having said so
that Yootha’s father had spoken as he had done on
the occasion of his visit to London with his wife
some months before, when they had tried to induce
Yootha to go back with them to Cumberland.</p>

<p>“I wish you would tell me, Yootha darling, what
is the matter with you these days.”</p>

<p>The speaker was her dear friend, Cora Hartsilver,
and as she spoke she encircled the girl with her
arm and pressed her cheek to hers.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you might tell just little me?”
she went on coaxingly, as Yootha tried feebly to
disengage herself. “Haven’t we always exchanged
secrets, and confided in each other implicitly? Don’t
say there is nothing the matter, because I can
see that you have something on your mind. I have
noticed the change in you for weeks, and others
have noticed it too. Who is it, my darling? Or
perhaps—&#8203;you will let me give one little guess?”</p>

<p>“Cora, what nonsense you talk!” the girl answered
quickly. “I am perfectly well, I have never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>been better, and there is nothing at all on my
mind.”</p>

<p>“On your word of honor?”</p>

<p>“On my word of—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>“Ah, I knew that like Washington you couldn’t
tell a lie,” Cora laughed. “Well, then, may I make
my little guess?”</p>

<p>“Oh, guess anything you like, if it gratifies a
whim!” Yootha exclaimed, coloring slightly. “I
suppose you are going to say that you think I am
in love! Why do married women always imagine
that every girl they meet is bound to be in love?
It’s a perfectly rotten notion. Men as a rule bore
me stiff, as I have often told you. The majority
of the men I meet, except a few in Bohemian circles,
seem not to have half-a-dozen original ideas of their
own.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that rather tautologic? Well, yes, many
men are dull, that I admit, but all are not dull,
even those who don’t live, or, so far as I know,
even mix in what you call Bohemian circles. Also
there are men, you know, who to some appear dull,
but to others....</p>

<p>“Do you remember a little lunch party at the
Ritz some time before the Armistice, Yootha?” she
went on. “We were invited by Archie La Planta,
and among the people he introduced to us was a
man who to most of us seemed unutterably dull—&#8203;beautiful
Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson, for instance, had
difficulty in concealing the fact that this man bored
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>her intensely, and yet I am convinced that even that
day Captain Charlie Preston attracted you in a
way you had never before been attracted by anyone,
and—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>She stopped for her friend’s expression had suddenly
completely changed. She was looking up
at Cora now with shining eyes, while her lips, slightly
parted, quivered a little as her breath came rather
quickly. Then all at once, as though acting on
impulse, she gripped Cora’s wrists.</p>

<p>“Who told you?” she asked in a quick undertone.
“I thought nobody even suspected.”</p>

<p>“Naturally you would. Women in love always
think, and often do, the wrong thing. Good heavens,
Yootha, I’ve known it for months! I suspected it
the first time you and he met, that day at the Ritz,
and the only thing I am surprised at is that you
should have kept me in ignorance—&#8203;or so you thought—&#8203;all
this time. Has he said anything yet?”</p>

<p>“Said anything? Of course not! What a question
to ask!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose it is silly to ask a girl if a man
who is obviously in love with her has asked her
to—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>“Say that again!” Yootha interrupted excitedly.
“Do you really mean it? Do you really think
that—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>“Well, go on—&#8203;think that he really loves you? I
don’t merely think it. I know it.”</p>

<p>“How? Has he told you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Yootha, we spoke a moment ago about people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>being dull. You, I think, are the most obtuse
person I have ever met.”</p>

<p>Thus they continued to talk, and the girl, having
at last fully admitted the truth, ended by baring
her soul to the woman who had so long been her
friend. Now, without fear or reticence, she told
Cora Hartsilver that she had fallen madly in love
that day at lunch at the Ritz with the wounded
officer who had, during the whole meal, hardly
spoken at all.</p>

<p>But it was at Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson’s “at home”
afterwards, she went on to explain, when they had
sat together listening to Tchaikowsky’s “None but
the Weary Heart,” that the full flood of her affection
had poured forth. It had poured forth in silence,
for naturally she had not dared on such short acquaintanceship,
to allow her feelings to betray themselves.
And ever since that afternoon the pain of
her love for the wounded man whom she had pitied
perhaps almost as much as she loved him, had continued
to increase.</p>

<p>While conversing the two women who were such
friends had been together on a settee. Now, all
at once, Cora Hartsilver became strangely silent.
Yootha looked at her in surprise for some moments.</p>

<p>“Why, Cora, what has come over you?” she
said suddenly, moving closer to her. “You are not
put out at what I have told you, are you?”</p>

<p>“Put out? Indeed no,” and as she spoke she
unconsciously laid her hand upon the girl’s and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>held it rather tightly. “No, I was only thinking—&#8203;it
was only something that—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>She caught her breath, and Yootha heard her
sob.</p>

<p>“Cora, Cora,” she exclaimed. “Oh, do tell me
what is the matter! What is it you are thinking
of?”</p>

<p>Their arms were about each other now, their
faces pressed together. Then, suddenly, Cora Hartsilver
broke down, and began to cry piteously.</p>

<p>“It is something I meant never to tell anybody,”
she said when at last Yootha had succeeded in
comforting her to some extent. “But what you
have told me about your love for Captain Preston
has brought it all back afresh. If I tell you, will
you promise on your word never to tell a living
soul?”</p>

<p>“Of course I will. I promise now, and on my
word. What is it, Cora? I have confided in you
completely, so surely you can confide in me? You
know I can keep a secret, don’t you, dear? Now
tell me all about it.”</p>

<p>For some moments Cora remained silent, at intervals
mopping her eyes with her pocket-handkerchief.
Then at last she said, speaking in a low
tone:</p>

<p>“You remember Sir Stephen Lethbridge?”</p>

<p>“Remember him? Why, of course.”</p>

<p>“Yootha, I was dreadfully in love with him! I
was in love with him when I married, and after my
marriage my love for him increased so that I hardly
knew what to do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
“But why have you never told me this before,
dear? I had not the slightest suspicion. Did Henry
suspect anything?”</p>

<p>“No. But then Henry was extraordinarily obtuse.
When I read in the newspaper the account
of the tragedy, he was in the room, but I managed
to conceal my feelings and to speak and act as
though nothing unusual had occurred. How I did
it I don’t know. And next day when we all lunched
at the Ritz, the day Captain Preston was introduced
to you, I showed nothing, did I? Yet my heart
was almost breaking.”</p>

<p>She paused a moment, and then continued:</p>

<p>“And that day—&#8203;Henry died! Oh, if only he
had died a little sooner, before poor Stephen had
made away with himself—&#8203;just think, Yootha, I
might have saved Stephen, he might be alive to-day,
and—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>She broke down suddenly and began to sob again
piteously. Minutes passed before her friend succeeded
in calming her once more.</p>

<p>“But how could you have saved his life even
if Henry had died sooner?” Yootha said presently
in a puzzled tone.</p>

<p>“Why, a week before, Stephen had written begging
me to come to him. He was in great trouble, he
declared, something he could not explain in a letter,
or, as he put it, ‘dared not explain.’ We had
been friends from childhood, as you know, and he
had, when a boy, told me many of his secrets. But
of course I couldn’t go. What excuse could I
have made to Henry? You know the sort of man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>Henry was, and how he thought it a wife’s ‘duty’
to have no secrets from her husband. Somehow
when I got that letter from Stephen the tone in
which he wrote frightened me. The thought actually
flashed through my mind that he might be contemplating
something dreadful, though I did not suspect—&#8203;that.”</p>

<p>“Did he know you were in love with him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he had known it a long time. Also he
looked on me as his best friend. What has worried
me so since his death is the thought of what can
have made him shoot himself. I had heard rumors
of his mixing with undesirable people; spending more
money than he ought. Those rumors may not
have been true. Even if they were, that could
not be a reason for him to take his life. I feel
convinced that what made him do it was something
he was going to tell me.”</p>

<p>“Your saying that, Cora, reminds me of Lord
Froissart. I hear that he is moving heaven and
earth to find out why Vera ended her life—&#8203;everybody
knows that she did end it. I hear he thinks
there was some mystery; also I am told—&#8203;though
this may not be true—&#8203;that he fancies Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson
knows the reason. She and Vera were
very intimate.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Yootha,” Mrs. Hartsilver exclaimed, now
fast recovering from her outburst of grief. “I
meant to have told you that Lord Froissart is
coming here this evening. I kept it secret at first,
because he is bringing, at my request, Captain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>Preston with him. I meant to spring Captain
Preston upon you as a surprise, because, as I have
told you, I knew all along you were in love with
him.”</p>

<p>Yootha could hardly contain herself. In her
ecstasy of delight she drew her friend to her and
kissed her.</p>

<p>“How perfectly sweet of you, Cora,” she cried.
“And how exactly like you that is, always trying
to give people pleasure. How soon will they be
here?”</p>

<p>“Lord Froissart is dining at his club, and Captain
Preston is dining with him. Lord Froissart said
he would bring him along after dinner.”</p>

<p>And so it came about that three days after the
incidents which had occurred in the house with the
bronze face, Lord Froissart, Captain Preston, Cora
Hartsilver and Yootha Hagerston were gathered
together in Cora’s drawing-room in her house in
Park Crescent.</p>

<p>Though at first the conversation of the four was
commonplace and conventional, by degrees, as was
inevitable, it drifted to a subject in which all were
deeply interested. Lord Froissart had been relating
as much as he deemed it advisable to tell them
about his unpleasant experience in the house with
the bronze face, when Cora suddenly asked:</p>

<p>“Might not the Metropolitan Secret Agency be
able to discover some clue which would lead to
the mysteries being cleared up which surround the
many strange deaths that have occurred within
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>the past year or so? You and I both have cause,
Lord Froissart, to wish that something could be
done in that respect.”</p>

<p>For a moment nobody spoke. Mrs. Hartsilver
and Lord Froissart had known each other some
years, and once before, about a month previously,
they had spoken about this.</p>

<p>“Well, as you have broached the subject,” he
said at last, “I don’t mind telling you now that
my visit to the house in question was made for the
purpose of consulting Stothert on that very point.
The series of tragedies that has occurred is so
remarkable that one cannot help thinking there
must have been some reason for it. And if I may
say so, Mrs. Hartsilver, your husband’s death was,
in my opinion, the most astonishing of all. I can
say with truth that if anybody had asked me to
pick out from among my many acquaintances the
man I considered the least likely to make an attempt
on his life, I should unhesitatingly have named poor
Hartsilver. Self-destruction was a thing we once
spoke about, and he appeared to have a horror
of the bare thought of it.”</p>

<p>“I wonder, Mrs. Hartsilver,” Captain Preston
said slowly, and as he spoke he fixed his great gray
eyes upon her, “if you can tell me anything about
this woman whose name seems to be on everybody’s
lips, and whose portrait we see in all the picture
papers—&#8203;this Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson?”</p>

<p>A tense silence followed.</p>

<p>“I am afraid I cannot,” Cora said, after a pause.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>“People say she is of Australian extraction, and
that her father was a sheep farmer.”</p>

<p>“I have heard that, too,” Lord Froissart said
quickly.</p>

<p>“Therefore three of us have heard it, and presumably
from different sources. Yet this afternoon
a friend of mine, George Blenkiron, who has lived
twenty years in Australia and knows the up country
and down, assured me that there is no sheep farmer
of the name of either Robertson or Mervyn-Robertson
out there, nor ever has been within his recollection.”</p>

<p>“But Mervyn-Robertson is surely her husband’s
name?” Yootha said.</p>

<p>“Quite right. Oddly enough, however, her maiden
name was Robertson. Blenkiron knew that much,
though he doesn’t live in London, or mix much in
London society. He found it out quite by accident,
and in rather a curious way.”</p>

CHAPTER <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>
</h3>
<h4>CONCERNS “DEAR JESSICA.”
</h4>
</div>


<p>Jessica Mervyn-Robertson was a remarkable
woman. Tall, with a wonderful figure, she looked
even taller than she actually was owing to her splendid
bearing. Graceful in her every movement,
wherever she went she focused attention. Her hair
was of that peculiar shade of auburn blending into
copper which seems, when the sun or the rays of
artificial light strike it, to be shot with golden
red. Her pale complexion contrasted oddly with the
natural crimson of her lips, and when she looked
at you there was an expression in her deep-set,
almost green eyes which few men could resist. And
yet perhaps what people noticed most about her was
the curious intonation of her voice, a voice never
forgotten by any man or woman who had once heard
it. Had she been a singer she would have been a
rich contralto.</p>

<p>She had appeared in London for the first time
some years before this story opens, and within
a few months had made hosts of friends. At that
time she had a suite of apartments at Claridge’s,
where she entertained largely and on a lavish scale.
Though nobody could say for certain whence she
came, or from what source she derived her fortune,
people of rank and others of social standing flocked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>to her receptions in their hundreds. She was said
to have a husband, though no one had ever seen
him, and nobody seemed in the least to care who
or what he might be. People were satisfied to
take so alluring a woman as they found her, and
so popular had she become before the end of her
first year in London, and so fashionable were her
social functions, that not to know Jessica Mervyn-Robertson
was to admit that you were <i lang="fr">hors concours</i>.</p>

<p>Aloysius Stapleton she had met for the first time,
so people said, on Gold Cup day at Ascot about
nine months after she had settled in London. Stapleton
had for several years been a man about town;
he was a well-to-do bachelor with a flat in Sandringham
Mansions, Maida Vale, and a small place in
the country, near Uckfield, whose calling in life
seemed to be the quest of pleasure and nothing else.
Certainly he had no profession, nor, apparently,
had he need of one. Wherever people belonging to
<i lang="fr">le monde ou l’on s’amuse</i> were to be found gathered
together, there you would meet “Louie” Stapleton,
dressed always in the height of fashion and ever
ready to entertain friends by inviting them to dine
or lunch, taking them to the theater, or even asking
them to spend week-ends with him at his place,
“The Nest,” in Sussex.</p>

<p>A day or two after Froissart and Preston, Cora
Hartsilver, and Yootha Hagerston had spent the
evening together at Cora’s house in Park Crescent,
Jessica Mervyn-Robertson, accompanied by Stapleton
and Archie La Planta and several other friends,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>sat in a box at the Alhambra watching the Russian
Ballet, then the fashionable attraction.</p>

<p>It was the first night of Scheherezade, and the
house was packed. Beautiful women gorgeously
gowned, and men immaculately dressed crowded
every box, and filled the stalls to overflowing. In
every direction diamonds and other precious gems
sparkled, and as the orchestra began the wonderful
overture the audience, which had been talking
volubly in anticipation of the silence which they
knew must follow, became gradually hushed.</p>

<p>The ballet ended, and the usual buzz of conversation
followed. So worked up had the audience
become by the terrible scenes of lust, followed by
carnage, that several women in the stalls were
laughing hysterically. An elderly man in the box
adjoining Jessica’s, who obviously came from the
provinces, and was witnessing Russian Ballet for the
first time, could be heard expostulating in a north
country accent against “such shows being permitted
in a civilized land.”</p>

<p>“And look at the clothes they wear—&#8203;or rather
don’t wear!” he went on, warming to his subject.
“I maintain such shows should be put down by
law. If I had known it would be like this I should
not have brought you, my dear,” this to a faded
woman, obviously his wife. “What has become
of the censor that a ballet like this is allowed?”</p>

<p>People in the theater exclaimed “Hush!” while
in the boxes adjacent there was much tittering. In
spite of his protests, however, he remained, and the
next ballet apparently met with his approval.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
Somebody knocked at the door of the box occupied
by Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson and her party, and
La Planta got up to see who it was.</p>

<p>After an exchange of whispers with the attendant,
he went out and shut the door.</p>

<p>When the second ballet ended, and he had not
returned, Jessica showed signs of uneasiness.</p>

<p>“What can have become of Archie?” she said to
Stapleton, who sat beside her. “Do you know who
wanted him?”</p>

<p>“No. I am going out for a minute, so I will ask
the attendant.”</p>

<p>But when he succeeded in finding the attendant,
she told him that the inquiry had been for Mrs.
Mervyn-Robertson. The gentleman to whom she
had given the message had said he would attend to
it, and had gone into the foyer.</p>

<p>“Did he take his hat?” Stapleton asked.</p>

<p>“No, he came out just as he was.”</p>

<p>“Then he cannot have left the theater. If you
should see him will you tell him, please, that I
have gone down to the foyer to find him?”</p>

<p>But La Planta was not in the foyer. Nor, apparently,
was he anywhere else in the theater.
Asked if a gentleman without a hat had gone out of
the theater within the last half hour, the commissionaire
replied that he had been absent a little
while, so would not like to say.</p>

<p>La Planta had not returned to the box when
Stapleton got back there, nor did he return at all.
Jessica, told by Stapleton that the inquiry had been
for her, looked at him oddly, but made no comment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
As usual, Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson—&#8203;or as all her
friends called her, Jessica—&#8203;entertained her theater
guests at supper at her house in Cavendish Square
after the performance. Both she and Stapleton expected
that La Planta would put in an appearance
there, but he did not.</p>

<p>It was quite a big supper-party, for people kept
arriving in cars until past one o’clock, so that when
at last it came to an end, the guests grouped about
the card tables in the room adjoining, playing
“chemmy” and other games, numbered over thirty.</p>

<p>“What can have become of him?” Jessica said
to Stapleton in an undertone as she drew him aside.
“And without his hat, too. I can’t imagine where
he can have gone, or who it can have been who
inquired for me. Archie ought to have told me!”</p>

<p>“I have telephoned twice to the Albany, but can
get no reply.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t, at this time of the night.”</p>

<p>“Why not? He has an extension to his man’s
bedroom.”</p>

<p>“Then do ring again, Louie. I am anxious about
him.”</p>

<p>This time Stapleton was more successful, for
after two futile attempts the operator got through,
and a sleepy, rather irritated voice asked huskily:</p>

<p>“Hello! hello! Who is that ringing?”</p>

<p>“It’s Mr. Stapleton, James. I am sorry to wake
you up, but can you tell me if Mr. La Planta has
come in?”</p>

<p>“If you will please to hold on, sir,” the voice
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>replied in a different tone, “I will ascertain and let
you know.”</p>

<p>For some minutes Stapleton waited with the receiver
glued to his ear. He was beginning to think
the man had gone to sleep again, when suddenly
he heard him returning. He sounded as if he were
running.</p>

<p>“Are you there, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Mr. La Planta is lying on his sofa, sir, fast
asleep. I’ve called him and shaken him, but he
won’t wake up. The light in his room was full
on. He must have been drugged or something. He
is breathing very heavy, very heavy indeed, sir.
I’m going to ring up the doctor.”</p>

<p>“No, don’t do that. I’ll come round at once and
see him; the doctor may not be wanted. Be ready
to let me in as soon as I arrive.”</p>

<p>The card-players still grouped about the little
tables were busy with their games. In a small room
beyond the drawing-room could be heard the rattle
of the little marble as it spun merrily round in the
well of the roulette, and a voice murmuring at intervals:
“<i lang="fr">Faites vos jeux</i>,” and “<i lang="fr">Rien n’ va plus</i>.”</p>

<p>Jessica came forward as she saw him approaching.</p>

<p>“Come into the hall,” he said in a low tone, “and
I will tell you.”</p>

<p>In a few words he explained to her what had
happened.</p>

<p>“Don’t be alarmed,” he ended. “I will go there
now, and will ring you up and report progress.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
Taxis were waiting in Cavendish Square, and
within five minutes he alighted at the Albany.</p>

<p>La Planta’s face was very pale. He lay with lips
slightly parted, breathing heavily. His eyelids were
but half closed, and though Stapleton drew one of
them up, the sleeper did not awake.</p>

<p>“Obviously doped,” he said to James, who stood
by with a frightened look.</p>

<p>He bent over his friend until their faces were
very close.</p>

<p>“And I think I know with what,” he added, thinking
aloud. “You have no idea, James, how long
he had been in?”</p>

<p>“None at all, sir. I didn’t know he was in until
you rang me up.”</p>

<p>“There is no need to send for a doctor,” Stapleton
said, as he straightened himself. “It is nothing
dangerous. His pulse is strong, and he will sleep
off the effects of the drug. By the way, did anybody
call to see him, or ring him up, while he was out
this evening?”</p>

<p>“Nobody called, sir, but a lady rang him up.”</p>

<p>“A lady? At about what time?”</p>

<p>The man thought for a moment.</p>

<p>“As near as may be, I should say it was nine
o’clock, sir.”</p>

<p>“Anybody you know? Did she give any name?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. It was not a voice I recognized.”</p>

<p>“Leave any message?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Just asked where Mr. La Planta was,
and I told her at the Alhambra. Then she asked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>who was with him, and I said you and Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson
I knew for certain, and I said I fancied
there were others. Then she said ‘Thank you’ and
rang off, sir.”</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought struck Stapleton, and he
slipped his hand into his friend’s pockets. But
apparently nothing was missing. From the breast
pocket he withdrew a wallet containing notes,
and from the trousers pocket a handful of
silver.</p>

<p>Then he went to the telephone and rang up Jessica.
But the voice which answered was not hers.</p>

<p>“Ask Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson to come to the
telephone, please,” he said.</p>

<p>“Is that Mr. Stapleton?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“John speaking, sir, the footman. I am afraid
she can’t, sir. She has been taken suddenly ill.”</p>

<p>“Ill! How? In what way?”</p>

<p>“She fainted dead off, sir, not five minutes after
you had gone.”</p>

<p>Stapleton paused for an instant. All at once an
idea flashed in upon him.</p>

<p>“John!”</p>

<p>“Sir?”</p>

<p>“Is anybody near the telephone? Can anybody
hear you speaking?”</p>

<p>“One moment, sir.”</p>

<p>Stapleton heard a door being quietly closed.</p>

<p>“Nobody can hear me now, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then tell me—&#8203;don’t speak loud—&#8203;did Mrs. Robertson
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>take anything, I mean drink or eat anything,
after I had gone out just now?”</p>

<p>There was a brief pause, then:</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, she drank a glass of champagne at the
sideboard.”</p>

<p>“Was anybody with her? Or near her? Did
anybody ask her if she would have a glass of wine?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, sir. A gentleman asked her. I happened
to be near. And I did notice that a lady
was by when she drank it. They each had a glass
of wine.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the lady and gentleman?”</p>

<p>“I know them well by sight, sir, but not their
names. They have been to supper before; once
or twice, I think, but they don’t often come.”</p>

<p>“Do they come together?”</p>

<p>“I think so, sir.”</p>

<p>“And you could describe their appearance to me?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, sir.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, John. Of course you will say nothing
of all this to anybody. You won’t forget that?”</p>

<p>“You can rely upon my absolute discretion, sir.”</p>

<p>“Good. I shall be back at Cavendish Square
within an hour, and I will see you then.”</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>
</h3>
<h4>IN WHICH A DISCOVERY IS MADE.
</h4>
</div>


<p>It was past four in the morning when Aloysius
Stapleton got back to his flat in Sandringham Mansions,
Maida Vale. After remaining with La Planta
nearly an hour, he had gone back to Cavendish
Square, where he found Jessica still unconscious,
her symptoms being somewhat similar to Archie’s,
though her brain, while she slept, seemed to be
active. Several times she had, he was told, murmured
incoherently, and twice she had spoken several
words. Even when he arrived there her lips
kept quivering at intervals, as if she were dreaming.</p>

<p>“How long ago did the guests leave?” he inquired
of her maid.</p>

<p>“The last few of them have not been long gone,”
she answered, “not above twenty minutes.”</p>

<p>“Do you know which were the last to go?”</p>

<p>“I don’t, sir. I only heard them leaving. Ought
she not to be put to bed now, as you don’t wish the
doctor to be sent for?”</p>

<p>“Yes, take her upstairs. She will be all right in
the morning.”</p>

<p>“I sincerely hope so. She is never taken this way—&#8203;never.”</p>

<p>The maid spoke almost reproachfully, as though
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>Stapleton were in some way responsible for her
mistress having fainted.</p>

<p>“Send John to me,” he said to her sharply.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson had been carried
up to her bedroom, Stapleton took the footman into
the dining-room and shut the door.</p>

<p>“Now, tell me,” he said, “who were the last to
leave to-night?”</p>

<p>The young footman described them. Yes, he
admitted that among them were the two guests, the
man and the woman, who had been with Jessica
while she drank champagne at the sideboard, but
he did not know their names.</p>

<p>Stapleton’s brain worked rapidly while he mechanically
undressed in his flat in Sandringham Mansions.
There could be no doubt, in his opinion,
that the hand that had drugged La Planta had also
drugged Jessica. In addition, he felt convinced that
whoever had done it had been among the guests at
Cavendish Square that evening. But who could it
have been, and with what object had he, or she,
committed the despicable act?</p>

<p>After ascertaining by telephone next morning that
both Archie and Jessica had recovered and were
once more in their right senses, he drove in his car
first to the Albany.</p>

<p>Archie, wrapped in an elaborate dressing-gown of
Japanese corded silk, was having breakfast in his
bedroom. He looked unusually pale, Stapleton
thought directly he entered, and there were dark
marks under his eyes.</p>

<p>“I wish you would tell me, Louie,” Archie said,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>“what happened to me last night, and how I managed
to come away from the Alhambra without my
hat. I might have imagined I had drunk too much—&#8203;had
there been anything to drink.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you nothing, because I know nothing,”
Stapleton answered, and went on to explain how
they had suddenly missed him from the box, and
what had happened afterwards.</p>

<p>“Who was it brought the message for Jessica,
and why did you leave the box without delivering
it to her?” he ended.</p>

<p>His friend drew his hand across his forehead
then pressed his fingers on his eyes, as though trying
to remember.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, Louie,” he said at last, “but I have
not the faintest recollection of receiving any message,
or of leaving the box. I can remember the
ballet, or rather the first part of it. After that my
mind is a blank. The next thing I remember is
waking up this morning and feeling very rotten. I
feel at sixes and sevens still.”</p>

<p>Not until lunch time was Stapleton able to see
Jessica, and then she complained of a headache and
of feeling utterly limp. When he questioned her
she replied that she had no recollection of drinking
champagne at the sideboard, or even of talking to
him after supper. She remembered her anxiety
about Archie, she said, and coming home in the car,
and Stapleton sitting beside her at supper, and
<i lang="fr">chemin de fer</i> and roulette being played. But there
her memory stopped.</p>

<p>“That is as I expected,” Stapleton said when she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>had ceased speaking. “Your symptoms are similar
to Archie’s. I should say, therefore, that you were
both doped with the same drug, one effect of which
apparently is to deaden memory not from the time
it is taken, but from a little while before it is taken.
I think it is clear that the individual who came to
the Alhambra with a message for you intended, by
some means, to give you the drug then. But Archie
took the message, went out, and presumably met
the person who brought it. Then, having failed to
see you, this person succeeded in drugging Archie,
came on here—&#8203;he, or it may have been a woman,
was evidently among your guests—&#8203;and actually
drugged you in your own house. Now the question
is—&#8203;why was it done? and by whom?”</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine.”</p>

<p>“Have you missed anything? Is your jewelry
intact, and are your other valuables safe?”</p>

<p>“I hope so. I haven’t looked.”</p>

<p>“Then you had better look at once.”</p>

<p>And then it was the discovery was made that the
safe in her boudoir had been opened and ransacked.
It had contained, in addition to a rope of priceless
pearls and a quantity of uncut diamonds, four
thousand five hundred and sixty-eight pounds in
Bank of England notes, Treasury notes, and cash,
moneys kept there for banking the roulette and the
other games of chance frequently played at her
house. The lot had vanished, and the safe had been
relocked and the key replaced in the little bag which
Jessica always carried concealed about her person.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>Unless a duplicate key had been employed, which
seemed hardly probable.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson was in despair; yet she
did not make a scene or become hysterical as so
many women would have done in the circumstances.
On the contrary, she kept her wits about her, and
remained singularly calm.</p>

<p>Just then John, the footman, entered the room
with some letters.</p>

<p>“Well, what am I to do about it?” she said to
Stapleton, controlling her voice.</p>

<p>“We can’t do better than consult the Metropolitan
Secret Agency,” he answered. “If they can’t
help us I don’t believe anybody can. Have you
the numbers of the notes?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“The Agency may be able to trace the pearls,
anyhow. There are only a few places in England
and on the Continent where stolen pearls of that
sort can be disposed of, and Stothert was telling me
only the other day that he knows the whereabouts
of every receiver of stolen goods in this country,
and on the Continent, too.”</p>

<p>The footman, having delivered the letters, retired,
closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>Stapleton and Jessica looked at each other oddly.</p>

<p>“Let us go and find Archie,” she said, preparing
to rise. “You say he told you he might remain at
home?”</p>

<p>But at that moment the door opened, and the
footman, entering again, announced:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
“Captain Preston and Mr. Blenkiron.”</p>

<p>Jessica bit her lip. Then, as the visitors came in,
she received them with her dazzling smile.</p>

<p>“How glad I am to see you after all this time,”
she exclaimed. “Mr. Stapleton was speaking of you
not five minutes ago, and I asked him what had
become of you both—&#8203;I thought you must have left
town.”</p>

<p>“I am rarely in town,” Blenkiron said. “I live in
the country, you know.”</p>

<p>“So you do. I had forgotten. But you, Captain
Preston, I never see you anywhere. Don’t you live
in town?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I rarely go about; my leg is such a
handicap, you see. We happened to be passing, so
I suggested our calling on the chance of finding you
at home. I have not been here since you gave that
delightful musical At Home—&#8203;eight or nine months
ago it must have been—&#8203;but I shall never forget the
way your friend sang Tchaikowsky’s ‘None but the
Weary Heart.’ It was too gorgeous.”</p>

<p>“Are you so fond of music? You are not like most
soldiers.”</p>

<p>“The one thing I love.”</p>

<p>“The <em>one</em> thing?” she laughed mischievously.
“That I can hardly believe!”</p>

<p>For an instant their eyes met. Hers were laughing,
mischievous still. His had grown suddenly
hard.</p>

<p>“Some one told me the other day,” Blenkiron
happened to remark, “that you lived at one time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>in Queensland, Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson. I have
been a great deal in Australia. Was it long ago?”</p>

<p>“Longer than I like to think about,” she answered.
“I was a girl when my parents sent me home.”</p>

<p>“You mean to England?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What town were you in, or near, when you lived
in Queensland?”</p>

<p>“Monkarra—&#8203;if one can call it a town,” she
answered.</p>

<p>“Indeed! I know Monkarra. I have been there
several times. I wonder I never met you or your
people.”</p>

<p>“Australia is a big place, Mr. Blenkiron.”</p>

<p>“But its population is small, and Monkarra, as
you say, is only a hamlet. Some one told me your
father’s name was Robertson.”</p>

<p>“People seem to have been talking a lot to you
about me,” she said quickly.</p>

<p>“And can you be surprised?”</p>

<p>The words conveyed two meanings, and Jessica
turned the conversation.</p>

<p>“As you are fond of music,” she said to Preston,
“you must honor me again with your company the
next time I have any. Men, for the most part, are
such Philistines. The only ‘music’ they seem to
care for is comic opera and ragtime.”</p>

<p>She talked more or less mechanically, for all the
while her thoughts were running on the loss she
had just sustained. One by one her guests of the
previous night passed in review through her mind.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>Each was in turn carefully considered, then dismissed
as being above suspicion in connection with
the theft.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, for no apparent reason, she
thought of Cora Hartsilver, and of her husband who
had killed himself. Quickly Yootha Hagerston followed—&#8203;she
rose into the vision of her imagination
with extraordinary distinctness. Both women she
disliked, she reflected; and she was sure that they
disliked her. And now she remembered being told—&#8203;yes,
Archie La Planta had told her—&#8203;that Captain
Preston admired the girl. Archie had said that
Preston “admired her extremely.”</p>

<p>And that girl, and Preston himself, also Cora
Hartsilver, had been trying—&#8203;this Archie had also
told her—&#8203;to extract information from him concerning
herself and her past. Could it be mere
coincidence that Preston and his friend Blenkiron
had called unexpectedly like this—&#8203;the first time they
had ever called—&#8203;and that Blenkiron should have
asked her questions about Australia? Who could
have told him, she wondered, that her father’s name
was Robertson?</p>

<p>“Talking of Australia,” Blenkiron’s voice held
her, “your father has been dead a good many years,
I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Ten years,” she heard herself saying; and unconsciously
she wondered why she said it.</p>

<p>“And your mother?”</p>

<p>“I was quite a child when she died.”</p>

<p>“And they lived at Monkarra?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
“My father did. My mother died in Charleville.”</p>

<p>“Strange,” Blenkiron was speaking to himself, “I
should not have met your father, or your mother,
during the years I was in Queensland.”</p>

<p>“But why should you have met them? What
were you doing in Australia?”</p>

<p>“I did all sorts of things there. I prospected for
gold for some years; and for years I was working
on a railway—&#8203;engineering work, you understand;
and then for a time I was sheep farming out there.
It is, in my opinion, the one country on earth.”</p>

<p>“And yet you have settled in England.”</p>

<p>“Because my interests are all in England now.
The war made such a change.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Preston rose.</p>

<p>“I must be going, Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson,” he
said. “I hope you will invite me the next time you
have music.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I shall not forget—&#8203;that is, if I have your
address. Shall I write it down?”</p>

<p>She went over to the escritoire, and he followed
her.</p>

<p>“Thirty-three, Q., Fig Tree Court, Temple,” he
said, and she made a note of it.</p>

<p>He limped slowly down the stairs, supporting himself
on his stick, and Blenkiron followed.</p>

<p>As they made their way into Oxford Street, Blenkiron
spoke.</p>

<p>“A clever woman—&#8203;a damned clever woman,” he
said. “And what a presence! What a personality!
Did you notice that to every question I put to her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>she had an answer—&#8203;pat! Yet I don’t believe a
word she said, or that she or her parents were ever
in Australia. There is some mystery about that
woman, and about that fellow Stapleton who is
always in her pocket.”</p>

<p>They had turned into Oxford Street, when Blenkiron
suddenly caught his companion by the sleeve.</p>

<p>“Look,” he said, “there goes young La Planta,
on his way to see our friends. That lad, too, I
have grave doubts about!”</p>

CHAPTER <abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr>
</h3>
<h4>BEFRIENDING A REPORTER.
</h4>
</div>

<p>Though several weeks had passed, no trace had
been discovered of Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson’s missing
property. For reasons of her own she had prevented
any mention of the robbery being made in
the newspapers, and apparently even the Metropolitan
Secret Agency had this time failed to make good.</p>

<p>Preparations were in progress for the great ball
to be given at the Albert Hall by Aloysius Stapleton
and his friend, young La Planta, and as Jessica
still said she preferred not to act as hostess on that
occasion, Stapleton had succeeded in enlisting the
services of a well-known peeress who, helped by
friends of her own, would receive his guests on the
eventful night.</p>

<p>It was expected that “all London” would be there,
and as the ball had been organized by Stapleton and
La Planta ostensibly in aid of some charitable object,
the newspaper press had laid itself out to give plenty
of publicity.</p>

<p>“If I had arranged to make it a private ball,”
Stapleton observed to Jessica one evening, “it would
have cost me an enormous sum, and hundreds who
have now bought tickets would not have done so.
I was right to take your advice—&#8203;you remember
telling me the way to make a ball of this sort an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>unqualified success, and at the same time run it at
other people’s expense, was to make it a ‘charity’
concern; get the newspapers to print columns of
fancy stories about it and publish lists of names of
people with titles likely to be present; and let it
be known that women of high social standing would
receive the guests. That advice was excellent,
Jessica. There has been such a rush for tickets that
if it continues we shall have to stop selling.”</p>

<p>“Have I ever given you bad advice?” Jessica
asked with a smile. “In matters of this sort, and
for that matter in most cases, a clever woman’s
advice is the safest advice to follow. You have not
yet asked me what I am going to wear. It is too
late now to tell you. But this I can say—&#8203;my dress
will surprise you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be surprised.”</p>

<p>“Naturally. Nobody does. But I have a reason
for wanting to surprise you at your own ‘charity’
ball,” and she laughed. “You will find out why,
later. Have you any idea what Cora Hartsilver and
her precious friend, Yootha Hagerston, intend to
wear?”</p>

<p>“Not the slightest. How should I? And why
should their dresses interest you?”</p>

<p>“They do interest me, and that is sufficient. If
you have not enough acumen to guess the reason,
I don’t think much of your intellectual foresight,”
and she laughed again in her deep contralto voice.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jessica Mervyn-Robertson and Cora
Hartsilver met often at receptions, dances and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>other social functions, and, though outwardly
friendly, each knew the other secretly hated her.</p>

<p>At a lunch party in Mayfair during the first days
of June there had been talk about Ascot, and Jessica
had mentioned casually that on Gold Cup Day fortune
invariably favored her. Twice, she said, she
had found herself at the end of the day much richer
than in the morning, “and in other ways,” she added,
“Gold Cup Day has helped me towards happiness.”</p>

<p>“Would it be too much to inquire what the other
ways were?” Cora, who sat near her at the angle
of the table, said lightly. “I can’t see how good
fortune could come to anybody on a race day except
through the actual racing unless—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>“Unless what?” Jessica asked quickly, with an
odd look, as Cora checked herself.</p>

<p>“Well, one might happen to meet somebody whom
afterwards one might come to like very much,”
Cora replied with a far-away look.</p>

<p>One or two people, happening to remember they
had heard somewhere that Jessica had first become
acquainted with Aloysius Stapleton at an Ascot
meeting, smiled.</p>

<p>“I agree,” Jessica said with exaggerated indifference.
“But the same thing might happen to anybody
anywhere—&#8203;say at lunch at the Ritz, or at
one of my own musical At Homes, or at—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>She was interrupted by one of the men at the
end of the table who, not seeing she was engaged
in conversation, inquired if she would make one of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>the party he meant to drive down to Ascot on his
coach.</p>

<p>“It is rather short notice, Mrs. Robertson,” he
added, “but until this morning I had not actually
decided to go down. Do say ‘Yes’ if you have not
made other arrangements.”</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted to come,” she answered after
a moment’s hesitation. “I suppose you mean Gold
Cup Day?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Gold Cup Day. That is good of you. Then
it is settled?”</p>

<p>“Lucky again!” Cora Hartsilver said with a
curious laugh. “I shall end by becoming superstitious
myself. Will you give me all the winners
on Gold Cup Day, Jessica?”</p>

<p>“Oh, then you will be there?”</p>

<p>“If I am lucky, too.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose Yootha with you? Oh! but I
needn’t ask,” she ended with a malicious little laugh.</p>

<p>The luncheon came to an end just then, which was
as well, for the two women were each awaiting an
opportunity to deal the other metaphorically a blow
between the eyes. For weeks past their hatred had
been smoldering. To-day it had come near to
bursting into flame.</p>

<p>When Cora met Yootha that afternoon, she at
once told her of her passage-of-arms at lunch with
Jessica Robertson, and of Jessica’s hardly veiled
sneer at their friendship.</p>

<p>“Why let that annoy you, Cora dear?” Yootha
exclaimed. “Heaven knows why the woman dislikes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>you so, or why she dislikes me, as I know she
does. I expect the truth is she has heard that we
are trying to find out who she is. And I mean to
go on trying, until I do find out.”</p>

<p>“And I am with you. I am as certain as that
I am standing here that she is an impostor of some
sort, though up to the present she and her friends,
Stapleton and La Planta, have been clever enough
to hide the truth. Has it never struck you as strange,
Yootha, that not a word got into the papers about
the theft of her jewelry and things, though all one’s
friends knew about it? What has made me think
of that now is that I was told this morning by a
friend of mine who writes or edits, or does something
for some paper—&#8203;no, you don’t know him—&#8203;that
Stapleton and Jessica Robertson both moved
heaven and earth to prevent the affair being reported
in the press.”</p>

<p>“But why?”</p>

<p>“Exactly—&#8203;but why? I was wondering if she
could have some reason for not wanting her name
to get into the papers, but as one sees it in all the
‘social columns’ every day—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>“That may have been the reason, nevertheless.
The jewelry, et cetera, were, if you remember,
apparently stolen by one of her guests that night,
and possibly she suspects one of them and is afraid
of the scandal which would follow if he, or she,
were convicted of the theft. Indeed, I can’t think
what other motive she can have had for not wanting
anything to be said in the papers about the crime.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
“I wonder,” Cora said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>They would probably have been surprised if they
had known that Captain Preston, too, who of course
had also heard of the robbery, had been puzzling
his brain to account for Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson’s
aversion from press publicity in connection with
the robbery.</p>

<p>“I tell you it’s devilish odd, George,” he had said
to his friend Blenkiron only the night before, as the
two sat smoking together in his rooms in Fig Tree
Court, “that woman and her dear friend Stapleton
being so desperately anxious to keep the affair out
of the papers. If you or I were burgled should we
care a button if the facts were made public or not?
Would anybody else whose house was burgled object
to the fact being known? Then why this hush-hush
movement on the part of Jessica Robertson and her
friends—&#8203;young La Planta, too, helped to keep it
quiet.”</p>

<p>“Who told you?”</p>

<p>“Harry Hopford. He was with me in Flanders
a long time, and I came across him in Whitefriars
only the other day—&#8203;he is back on his newspaper
again. He said the steps that woman and her two
friends took to prevent mention being made in the
papers of the robbery at her house during one of
her night parties, aroused a good deal of conjecture
in Fleet Street. Some of the reporters were actually
paid to say nothing about it. He told me so himself.”</p>

<p>For some moments both were silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
“She must have had some strong motive for wanting
to hush it up,” Blenkiron said at last.</p>

<p>“That is what I say. Now, what can the reason
have been? I tell you again, George, there is more
behind those people than anybody suspects. And
who are they? And where do they come from?
You can try as you like, but you won’t find out.”</p>

<p>“I certainly don’t believe Mrs. Robertson’s story
that her father was a sheep farmer in Queensland.
I know every town and village in Queensland, have
known them over twenty years, and it is impossible
that if her father had been sheep farming out there,
even in a small way, I should not have known him,
at any rate by name.”</p>

<p>“It seems that the police were not notified of the
theft. Only the Metropolitan Secret Agency was
told about it, and for a wonder it failed to discover
a clue. You know how clever that Agency is in
running thieves to earth. I am told it hardly ever
fails, though there are queer rumors as to the
methods it employs to catch criminals.”</p>

<p>It was Harry Hopford, though Preston did not
know it, who had told Cora Hartsilver about the
hushing up in the press. They were not intimately
acquainted; Hopford had met Cora at a dance one
night which he was attending professionally, and
afterwards they had recognized each other at the
Chelsea Flower Show and engaged in conversation.
Thus neither Hopford nor Cora suspected that the
other was acquainted with Captain Preston.</p>

<p>It so happened that, some days after this conversation,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>Hopford had occasion to call to see Stapleton
to obtain from him some facts about the approaching
ball at the Albert Hall. Being, as all journalists
have to be, of an inquisitive disposition, he referred
incidentally to the theft of jewelry and notes from
Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson’s house in Cavendish
Square, and casually inquired if the stolen property
had been recovered.</p>

<p>“I am sure I don’t know,” Stapleton answered
quickly. “What makes you think I should know?”</p>

<p>“I thought you might,” Hopford replied calmly,
“as you are acquainted with the lady and were at
supper at her house on the night of the robbery.”</p>

<p>“Who told you I was there?”</p>

<p>“Oh, the press generally knows these things.”</p>

<p>“‘The press,’ as you call it, is a damned nuisance
at times,” Stapleton said sharply. “I suppose a report
of that robbery would have appeared in every
paper if Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson had not asked the
editors to refrain from giving her undesirable notoriety.
I can’t think why newspapers always want
to publish detailed reports of crimes. Such reports
do a lot of harm, I am sure—&#8203;a lot of harm.”</p>

<p>“The papers wouldn’t publish the reports if the
public was not anxious to read them,” Hopford replied
with assurance. “You should blame the public,
Mr. Stapleton, not the press.”</p>

<p>“Nothing ever did appear about that robbery,
did it?” Stapleton asked, looking at the young reporter
rather oddly.</p>

<p>“Not so far as I am aware.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
Stapleton remained silent for a minute. He
seemed to be thinking.</p>

<p>“Are you ever in need of money, my lad?” he
inquired suddenly.</p>

<p>Hopford laughed.</p>

<p>“Show me the journalist who isn’t,” he said.
“Why?”</p>

<p>“Supposing I made it worth your while—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s like this—&#8203;by the way, what’s your
name?”</p>

<p>“Hopford—&#8203;Harry Hopford.”</p>

<p>“Come and sit down, Hopford—&#8203;here, have a cigar.
Now then, I am in a position to be able to do you
a good turn now and again, in other words, to benefit
you pecuniarily, if in return you will do as I suggest
and at the same time keep absolutely silent about
it. Don’t think I am going to ask you to do anything
terrible. I am not,” and he smiled.</p>

<p>“I dare say it could be managed,” Hopford answered
dreamily, as he began to enjoy the cigar.
“Hadn’t you better tell me exactly what it is you
want me to do, then I shall be able to give you a
straightforward answer at once. Anything you may
tell me I shall, of course, consider confidential.”</p>

<p>“That’s the spirit; that’s the way I like to hear
a young fellow talk. Well now, listen.”</p>

<p>Stapleton glanced towards the door to see that
it was shut, then continued:</p>

<p>“There are several things you may be able to do
for me from time to time, and the first is this. I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>am practically certain I know who took the diamonds
and the notes, and the rest of the stuff stolen that
night, and though naturally I don’t intend to mention
the lady’s name, I can hint at it. I believe the
thief—&#8203;yes, thief—&#8203;to be a young widow whose husband
died in tragic circumstances nine or ten months
ago—&#8203;he was found dead in his bath one morning;
possibly you recollect the affair.”</p>

<p>“I ought to, seeing that I was sent to the house
the same day to obtain particulars of the tragedy.
The house is not far from Portland Place—&#8203;am I
right?”</p>

<p>“Quite.”</p>

<p>“So the widow was among Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson’s
guests at supper that night?”</p>

<p>“She was not. She was not even invited. Yet
I have a good reason for supposing she was admitted,
though the hostess never saw her.”</p>

<p>“Would that have been possible?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. There was a great crush. At one
time during the night one could hardly force one’s
way through it, and it was then the widow was
admitted, the footman believing her to be an invited
guest.”</p>

<p>“Could you get me an interview with the footman?”</p>

<p>“Quite impossible, my dear fellow. Besides, it
may not have been the footman who admitted her.
That was merely my conjecture. It may have been
one of the other servants.”</p>

<p>“The butler, for instance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
“No, not the butler.”</p>

<p>“And you are sure that she was there? You saw
her?”</p>

<p>“No, no; don’t jump at conclusions. I didn’t see
her—&#8203;myself.”</p>

<p>“Then who did?”</p>

<p>“That I must not tell you. It would be unwise.”</p>

<p>“I have promised to respect your confidence.”</p>

<p>“Quite so, or I should not have told you what I
have. But names, you know, are sacred things. If
I mentioned names it would be impossible for me
afterwards to swear I had not done so, should an
occasion for taking the oath, by some unforeseen
chance, arise.”</p>

<p>“I see your point. Well, can you, without committing
yourself, hint to me the reason you believe
the lady, whose identity you have practically revealed
to me, ransacked Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson’s
safe? Was it, should you say, for the intrinsic value
of the things stolen, or was there some deeper
reason?”</p>

<p>“Such as?”</p>

<p>“Documents, compromising letters, anything of
that sort?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid I must not answer that either. You
see, one has to be so careful. My idea in telling you
as much as I have is that you should, without, of
course, making any definite statement, hint in your
paper that the crime was committed by a young
widow well known in Society; you might go so far
as to say the widow lost her husband in tragic circumstances
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>comparatively recently, and you might
also work in some fancy padding of your own. You
could add that you had obtained your information
from a trustworthy source.”</p>

<p>“Meaning you.”</p>

<p>“Of course. Who else?”</p>

<p>“And what terms do you propose?”</p>

<p>“That I must leave to you to suggest.”</p>

<p>“I would sooner the offer came from you, Mr.
Stapleton.”</p>

<p>Stapleton hesitated a moment, then:</p>

<p>“Would a ten-pound note about meet the case?
You see, you score by getting what I believe you
call a ‘scoop’ for your paper.”</p>

<p>“And run the risk of being fired if the lady hinted
at should think fit to bring an action against my
paper. Oh, no, Mr. Stapleton, I am not out to take
sporting chances for the sake of pocketing a tenner.
If you had said eighty or a hundred pounds I might—&#8203;I
say might—&#8203;have felt tempted to take a chance,
but a tenner—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>He rose, preparatory to leaving.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Hopford, wait a minute,” Stapleton
exclaimed, trying to conceal his eagerness as
he laid a hand on the lad’s shoulder to detain him.
“I asked you to name a sum, remember—&#8203;I have no
idea what terms are usual in such cases. Sit down
again and I may, after all, be able to meet your
wishes.”</p>

<p>With assumed reluctance the reporter sank back
into the chair from which he had just risen, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>for another ten minutes he and Stapleton continued
to converse. And when, finally, the former left the
house, he carried in his breast-pocket five new ten-pound
notes, and chuckled as he thought of Stapleton’s
promise to hand him five more notes on the
publication of the scoop.</p>

<h4>A PARAGRAPH FOR THE PAPERS.
</h4>
</div>


<p>“Fifty pounds easily earned,” Hopford murmured
as he strolled along Maida Vale, looking about him
for a taxi. “I thought all along that fellow was hot
stuff, in spite of the way the papers cocker him up.
And so he wants people to think Mrs. Hartsilver
committed, or at any rate had a hand in, that theft?
What a blackguard! Now, I wonder why he owes
her a grudge? Yes, he must owe her a grudge, and
a pretty bad one, or he would never go so far as
that.”</p>

<p>Quickly his train of thought ran on. There was
not an empty taxi in sight, so he decided to walk
part of the way. One thought led to another. Solutions
to the problem which puzzled him suggested
themselves, only to be dismissed one after another
as improbable. Then suddenly an idea occurred to
him. Could there be another woman in the case?
Some woman who was jealous of Mrs. Hartsilver?</p>

<p>Instantly the name Jessica Robertson rose to his
lips. Why, of course, that must be it! At a loss to
suspect any of her guests of having robbed her safe,
she would take the opportunity, if opportunity
occurred, of casting suspicion on the widow who
lived in Park Crescent, and whose beauty and personality
rivaled her own. Stapleton’s partiality for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson was common talk. She, no
doubt, had hinted her desire to him, and he had
happened to remember it while being interviewed
on the subject of the approaching ball.</p>

<p>So far, so good. A mystery to a newspaper reporter
is like red meat to a tiger. Hopford felt that
he had struck a mystery now which might develop
later into a scandal. Then he remembered that at
the Chelsea Flower Show he had met Mrs. Hartsilver.
He must become friendly with her, and then
he would play his cards.</p>

<p>He entered his office with a light heart. Those
five ten-pound notes would be most useful, but what
gratified him most was the thought of the news
“story” he felt he was on the track of. Not the
“story” Stapleton had hinted at. From the first he
had not had the slightest intention of using that.
Even if it possessed a grain of truth, which he
doubted, that was not the sort of stuff he wanted
for his paper, while to set out deliberately to wreck
a woman’s good name on no evidence in return for
payment, was not to be countenanced for a moment.</p>

<p>No, he would never see that second fifty pounds.
And, so thinking, he sighed.</p>

<p>“Hullo, what’s up?” asked a colleague who sat
near him. “Got the hump or something?”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut it!” Hopford snapped. “I’m dog tired.”</p>

<p>“For that matter so am I, but I don’t groan over
it,” his neighbor rapped back. “And yet I well
might, after reporting two inquests and a cremation
in one afternoon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
Hopford laughed.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” he said. “Yesterday you attended
two parades of <i lang="fr">mannequins</i>, one in swimming suits.
You told me so yourself, so you haven’t much to
grumble at.”</p>

<p>For some minutes both went on writing, turning
out their “copy” at a great pace.</p>

<p>“Odd thing this suicide—&#8203;what?” Hopford’s friend
remarked as he laid down his fountain pen at last
and pinned his sheets of copy together.</p>

<p>“What suicide?” Hopford inquired, while his pen
ran swiftly on.</p>

<p>“You haven’t heard? Everybody is talking about
it in the clubs, though none of the evening papers
has the story. I got details at the Junior Carlton,
where I dined to-night. Lord Froissart belongs
there.”</p>

<p>“Froissart! You don’t mean that Lord Froissart
has committed suicide!” Hopford exclaimed, stopping
in his work and looking up.</p>

<p>“Why, yes. His body was found at the foot of
the cliffs at Bournemouth about six o’clock this
evening. Nobody saw him go over, apparently, but
while I was at the Junior Carlton the man I was
dining with, a friend of Froissart’s, got a telegram
from a friend in Bournemouth saying that an open
letter had just been found in the dead man’s pocket,
in which he confessed that he was about to take
his life. My friend says Froissart never really got
over the shock of his daughter’s suicide—&#8203;it was
suicide in her case, too, of course. He also said that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>of late Froissart had been looking terribly ill and
worried. It’s a good story, anyhow, and I think I
have more facts than any other morning paper will
get hold of. Lucky I happened to be dining with a
man who knew Froissart intimately—&#8203;what?”</p>

<p>Next day the papers were full of the tragedy.
Lord Froissart had, it seemed, left his house in
Queen Anne’s Gate about eleven o’clock in the morning,
the time he usually went out. He had called to
see his lawyers, in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, shortly before
noon, and remained there about three quarters
of an hour. From there he had gone, apparently on
foot, to the Metropolitan Secret Agency, “the house
with the bronze face,” and after interviewing Mr.
Alix Stothert, head of that concern, had lunched
alone at Frascati’s. He had caught the three thirty-seven
train to Bournemouth, and after that nothing
more was known until his body had been found at
the foot of the cliffs by some children, who had at
once run home and told their parents, who, in turn,
had notified the police. All this the newspapers had
succeeded in ferreting out before their late editions
went to press.</p>

<p>The report written by Hopford contained certain
intimate and exclusive details, however. Lord Froissart
had stayed late at the Junior Carlton the night
before, writing one letter after another. A waiter
of whom he had inquired at what times fast trains
left for Bournemouth said he had thought his lordship
seemed “excitable and nervy.” Before leaving
the club, he added, deceased had pressed a five pound
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>note into his hand, greatly to his surprise, for
he had never before known Lord Froissart to infringe
the club rules.</p>

<p>In addition this report stated that the writer
knew for a fact that Lord Froissart had on several
occasions recently spoken about suicide, a subject
in which he appeared suddenly to evince a deep
interest. Further, he had asked a friend of the
writer’s, two days previously, if he had any idea
what height the highest cliffs at Bournemouth were,
and if he had ever heard of any one committing
suicide by jumping off them. A sealed letter found
on the body was addressed in deceased’s handwriting
to his elder and only surviving child, the Honorable
Mrs. Ferdinand-Westrup, then living in Ceylon with
her husband, who was a tea planter. No motive
could be assigned for Lord Froissart’s having taken
his life, though the shock of his daughter’s death
the year before might have unhinged his mind.</p>

<p>Some days later the usual verdict was returned—&#8203;“Suicide
whilst temporarily insane,” and within a
fortnight the tragedy had been virtually forgotten.</p>

<p>By all except one or two people. Captain Charles
Preston remembered it; so did Cora Hartsilver, and
so did Yootha Hagerston. And the reason they
remembered it was this.</p>

<p>Lord Froissart died quite a rich man. His sole
heir ought by rights to have been his daughter,
Mrs. Ferdinand-Westrup. Instead, the bulk of his
fortune and property were left to an individual of
whom nobody, apparently, had ever heard—&#8203;a Mrs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>Timothy Macmahon, described as the widow of
Timothy Macmahon of Cashel, Co. Tipperary, and
the will, which was not yet proved, had been executed
on the morning of the very day of the tragedy,
at the offices of Messrs. Eton, West and Shrubsole,
solicitors, of Lincoln’s Inn Fields.</p>

<p>Now those solicitors, as Preston happened to
have heard from his servant, whose brother was a
clerk in Eton, West and Shrubsole’s office, were
solicitors also to Jessica Mervyn-Robertson. A coincidence,
perhaps, as Preston said to Cora Hartsilver
a day or two after Froissart’s death, yet in
his opinion a curious coincidence.</p>

<p>And when, ten days later, Hopford succeeded in
obtaining an interview with Cora Hartsilver, and
told her of his interview with Aloysius Stapleton,
and what Stapleton had tried to induce him to
hint at in the newspaper—&#8203;feeling it his duty to tell
her, he had no hesitation in breaking faith with
Stapleton—&#8203;events in the life of Aloysius Stapleton
began to look peculiar.</p>

<p>But still Stapleton and his intimate friends, Archie
La Planta and Jessica Mervyn-Robertson, were to
be met everywhere. Still their movements were
chronicled almost daily in the social columns of the
London press, while their portraits appeared frequently
in the weekly periodicals.</p>

<p>But perhaps nowhere was Jessica so much noticed
as at Ascot. The daily and the weekly papers had
apparently laid themselves out to give her as much
publicity there as possible. She was seen in her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>car arriving on the course, accompanied by half a
dozen friends, among them of course Stapleton and
La Planta. She was seen walking on the course;
she was seen in the paddock congratulating the
owner of the winner of the Gold Cup; she was seen
smiling at a duchess and shaking hands with a peer;
she was seen conversing with a foreign premier.</p>

<p>Then the fashion papers “featured” her costumes—&#8203;the
gown she wore on the first day of the meeting,
on the second day, and so on; the gowns she wore
on different nights at the opera; the gowns she wore
at Hurlingham, at Ranelagh, at the Military Tournament
at Olympia, at the Richmond Show, on her
houseboat above Henley until at last even her
friends began seriously to ask one another who this
woman was who, coming from nowhere, and unknown,
had thus conquered London Society by her
charm, her personality, and her beauty, but most of
all, perhaps, by her lavish display and her extravagance.</p>

<p>And naturally people who were not her friends,
women more especially, whispered. Others, when
her name was mentioned, would smile significantly;
smiles which did more harm than the whispers. For
though nothing could be openly said against her,
yet her would-be detractors were glad to insinuate
evil.</p>

<p>That friend of hers, for instance, Aloysius Stapleton,
why was he always at her heels? There might,
of course, be no harm in the relationship; but on
the other hand there might be harm, and as there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>might be there probably was. That was the attitude
many adopted towards her who nevertheless accepted
her hospitality and were glad to be invited to her
receptions—&#8203;receptions which certainly were the talk
of all the town. Yet, curiously enough, she had refused
to act as hostess at the great ball to take place
at the Albert Hall; more, she had declined to be
included among the society hostesses who would receive
the three thousand or more guests that night.</p>

<p>Why was that?</p>

<p>It was Hopford who asked the question, and he
put it to Captain Preston. In short, while the social
world of London for the most part worshiped at the
shrine of the mysterious Jessica Mervyn-Robertson,
Captain Preston, Hopford, Cora Hartsilver, Yootha
Hagerston and George Blenkiron were banding
themselves together—&#8203;a little group of skeptics determined
to find out who Jessica actually was, and
who her friends were.</p>

<p>Perhaps had they known the sensation the approaching
great ball at the Albert Hall held in
store for them they would have hesitated before
meddling with the affairs of Jessica Mervyn-Robertson,
the idol of London Society.</p>

CHAPTER <abbr title="Eleven">XI.</abbr>
</h3>
<h4>HUSH MONEY!
</h4>
</div>


<p>You would think, judging by the newspapers, that
the great balls which take place periodically in London
at the Albert Hall and elsewhere presented
scenes of wild delight approaching revelry. Many,
in reality, are deadly dull affairs, and respectable
beyond words, while others are so crowded that
dancing becomes an impossibility. Of course there
are always people who like to be “seen everywhere”
in order to give their friends the impression that
they are “in the swim” of London life, fashionable
and otherwise. Such folk you will usually find to
be <i lang="fr">poseurs</i> of a peculiarly unintelligent type, the sort
of men and women who are never natural, never
“themselves” as it is called, and who act and talk
always to impress those who may see or hear them.</p>

<p>Among the three thousand or more men and
women who had bought tickets for the great ball
organized and ostensibly to be given by Aloysius
Stapleton and young Archie La Planta, were hundreds
of people of that type, the class of individual
who, before the war, loved to squander money and
still more to let folk see how recklessly they squandered
it. Stapleton, who knew his world, had purposely
advertised his ball with a view to what he
called “roping in” these people by making a great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>to do regarding the many well-known social representatives
who would be present, in addition to theatrical
stars and other more or less Bohemian folk.</p>

<p>What he went nap on, however, were the social
representatives. Like most people who move about
he had noticed that since the war the glamor which
in pre-war days enveloped well-advertised stage folk
had faded considerably, and that, owing possibly to
the sudden rise to affluence of profiteers and their
wives and other beings of common origin and snobbishly
inclined, men and women of birth and breeding
and real distinction now held the limelight almost
entirely.</p>

<p>“I think I can say without conceit that it will be
the most talked of event of its sort, not only of the
present season, but of any season for years past,” he
observed complacently to Jessica, some days before
the great night, “and I will admit that for that I am
largely indebted to you, Jessica. By the way, I wish
you would tell me what your dress is to be.”</p>

<p>“Why waste time trying to make me tell you what
I have already told you I am not going to tell you?”
Jessica asked, as she lay back in a great soft fauteuil
and blew a cloud of smoke into the middle of the
room. “You will see enough of it on the night, I can
assure you. Our supper party ought to be a great
success,” she added, changing the subject.</p>

<p>The telephone on the escritoire rang, and she
went over to answer it.</p>

<p>“It is the Metropolitan Secret Agency,” she said
a moment later. “They want to speak to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
Stapleton picked up the receiver, and as he did
so the door opened and a middle-aged little man with
a semitic cast of countenance was shown in.</p>

<p>It was the Hebrew, Levi Schomberg, who, Stapleton
had told La Planta some weeks before, “lent
money to his friends.” He had told him at the same
time that Schomberg had warned him against
“Hartsilver’s widow” on the ground that she was a
designing woman.</p>

<p>Stapleton had difficulty in concealing his annoyance
at Levi’s arrival just as he was on the point
of conversing with the house with the bronze face,
and after replying to one or two questions which
the Agency put to him he hung up the receiver and
went across to Schomberg, with whom he shook
hands.</p>

<p>“I need an extension to this house badly,” he said
pointedly to Jessica. “You might remind me to-morrow
to see about it.”</p>

<p>But Levi did not, or pretended that he did not
note the point of that observation.</p>

<p>“And to what do I owe the honor of this visit?”
Stapleton asked as he pushed an arm-chair towards
Schomberg. “Is it business this time, or pleasure?
And why have you come here instead of to my flat?”</p>

<p>“Some of each, and a little of both,” the little man
answered with a grin. “You guess what I come
about, no doubt?”</p>

<p>“Not being mentally incapacitated as yet, I do,”
Stapleton answered, biting his lip. “I think you
might have waited until after the ball on Thursday
night,” he added in a tone of annoyance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
“Several thought that when I approached them
to-day,” the Jew said slyly. “But, as I ask
them, why after the ball instead of now? What
is the matter with now? Isn’t now good
enough?”</p>

<p>“Well, out with it. How much do you want this
time?”</p>

<p>“Eight thousand. Only eight thousand—&#8203;this
time.”</p>

<p>Stapleton glared at him, and had anybody caught
sight of Jessica at that moment he would have had
difficulty in believing her to be the same woman, so
distorted with fury had her face become.</p>

<p>“Eight thousand!” Stapleton exclaimed. “It’s
preposterous—&#8203;I haven’t the money.”</p>

<p>Levi Schomberg made a little click with his tongue,
which might have meant anything.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear that, Louie,” he said carelessly.
“Is it not strange that though you appear always to
have unlimited cash to fling about, yet whenever I
call to see you the cupboard is bare? Still, I need
that sum, and you know that what I need I always
end by getting, even if in order to get it I am forced
to tighten the screw. Come now, when can you hand
it to me? Shall we say to-morrow at twelve, at the
same place as before?”</p>

<p>Stapleton had begun to pace the floor. Jessica,
her fingers twitching nervously, watched him with
an evil expression. It was easy to see that for some
reason the man and the woman, usually so self-possessed,
were in their visitor’s power.</p>

<p>Thus a minute or two passed. Then, all at once,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>Stapleton came to a halt and, turning sharply, faced
Levi Schomberg.</p>

<p>“If I give you that sum, say on Friday—&#8203;to-day is
Tuesday—&#8203;will you undertake, in writing, to stop
this persecution?”</p>

<p>“In writing? Oh, no. Besides, I could not, in
any case, promise to stop what you are pleased to
call ‘this persecution,’ for where else should I go
for the money? My demands are not exorbitant,
Louie, judged by the length of your purse. Were
you less rich, my requests would be moderated in
proportion to your income. That, as I think you
know, is my invariable rule. I find out exactly what
my ‘client’s’ income is from all sources, and I regulate
my tariff accordingly. That is only fair and
just. May I take it then that on—&#8203;Friday—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>“Get out of my sight!”</p>

<p>“No, don’t say that, don’t employ that tone,” the
little Jew went on, in no way disconcerted. “I have
news to give you—&#8203;good news, Louie, think of
that!”</p>

<p>He crossed his legs, and lay back in his chair.
Then, thrusting his hands deep into his trousers
pockets, he said:</p>

<p>“Louie—&#8203;and Jessica,” glancing at each in turn,
“you will be happy to hear that though secret inquiries
are being made about you on all sides, nothing,
as the newspapers say, ‘has as yet transpired.’”</p>

<p>“Who has been making inquiries?” Jessica asked
quickly.</p>

<p>“Why, who but the lady to whom you are so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>devoted—&#8203;Cora Hartsilver, also her shadow, Yootha
Hagerston, also a Captain Preston, also a young
journalist named Hopford, and lastly a friend of the
lot, whose name is Blenkiron. Those five have set
themselves the task of discovering all about both
of you, and about Archie, and I should not be surprised
if presently they hit upon the right trail. If
they don’t hit it they won’t fail for want of trying,
and if by some mishap the <i lang="fr">douceur</i> I have mentioned
should go astray on Friday—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, Levi, you wouldn’t do that—&#8203;you
couldn’t!”</p>

<p>Jessica had sprung to her feet and, abandoning
her habitual calm, seemed beside herself.</p>

<p>“Naturally I wouldn’t do it, though I disagree with
you that I couldn’t, Jessica,” the little man said in
his even tones, partly closing his eyelids as though
to get her profile in better perspective.</p>

<p>Jessica looked relieved.</p>

<p>“Always supposing,” he went on, “you keep your
part of the bargain.”</p>

<p>“Bargain!” Stapleton exclaimed. “I never made
a bargain. You wanted me to, but I refused—&#8203;we
both refused. You can’t have forgotten that!”</p>

<p>“I forget everything I don’t wish to remember,”
Levi replied, his eyes now only slits. “Jessica, you
look very beautiful to-day—&#8203;more beautiful than you
have ever looked, or than I have ever seen you
look. I am not surprised that London raves about
you.”</p>

<p>He rose before she could reply, and extended his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>hand, which she took reluctantly. He held it a
moment longer than the occasion seemed to warrant,
then dropped it.</p>

<p>“On Friday, then,” he said, addressing Stapleton.
“On Thursday night we may not meet, you will
both be so very busy, or should I say so much in
demand? Unless of course you invite me to join
your party. So good-by for the moment.”</p>

<p>Stapleton did not go down to see him out, nor did
he ring for the servant. Instead, he shut the door
directly the little man had left the room.</p>

<p>The front door slammed, and still the two sat in
silence. At last Jessica said in a metallic voice:</p>

<p>“What are we to do, Aloysius?”</p>

<p>“There is nothing to be done,” he answered. “We
must go on paying, and paying, until—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>“Until what?”</p>

<p>Suddenly his expression changed. Then, after a
pause, he said:</p>

<p>“Supposing Levi were to die unexpectedly; how
convenient it would be, Jessica.”</p>

<p>Their eyes met, and he knew that the same
thought had just occurred to Jessica.</p>

<p>“People die suddenly of all sort of common complaints,”
he went on. “Heart failure, apoplexy,
stoppage of the heart’s action, natural causes—&#8203;—Supposing
he died of a natural cause,” he added
in an undertone.</p>

<p>“Supposing! Well, it would mean one Hebrew
less in the world.”</p>

<p>“And many thousands of pounds left in our pockets
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>which, under existing conditions, will have to come
out of them.”</p>

<p>“It is worth considering.”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“As long as he remains alive, remember, we shall
be subjected to repetitions of the sort of visit he
has just paid us.”</p>

<p>And, while they talked, Levi Schomberg, threading
his way along the crowded pavement of Oxford
Street, had but one thought in his mind.</p>

<p>Jessica.</p>

<p>He had always admired her, but now she had completely
bewitched him. Surely—&#8203;surely with the
woman in his power, and with Stapleton, too, in his
power, anything and everything should be possible?
But how set about it? What would be his best and
most direct mode of attack?</p>

<p>Another thought came to him. Where was
Mervyn-Robertson? He knew the fellow was not
dead, but what had become of him, and in what
corner of the world was he at that moment? If
only he could find out, Robertson himself might be
employed in some capacity to achieve his end. When
he had last heard of Robertson, some years before,
the man had been in dire straits, and when a man
of his type and way of living came to be in dire
straits, he reflected, he generally remained in that
state until the end of the chapter.</p>

<p>Then there was Mrs. Hartsilver. Hating Jessica,
and striving all she knew to find out all about her,
she might serve sooner or later as a useful lever.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>When two women, both beautiful, and both moving
in the same social circle, come to entertain a bitter
enmity for each other, anything may happen, or
be made to happen, he reflected. And Jessica had
other enemies as well among “the people who count,”
he remembered. Yes, with the aid of a little tact,
a little ingenuity—&#8203;—</p>

<p>People passing glanced at him in astonishment,
wondering why he smiled.</p>

<p>He wandered into the Park at Marble Arch, for
it was a beautiful afternoon and the sight of the
trees in full foliage always appealed to his artistic
eye. Scores of cars containing people obviously of
leisure kept rolling past, and as he watched them
his imagination wove romances round some of the
occupants of the cars. Among the faces many were
familiar to him; he recognized two of his clients.</p>

<p>A self-satisfied smile parted his lips.</p>

<p>“Who would think, to look at them,” he said aloud,
“they would not have a shilling in the world if I
chose to foreclose? Yet there are folk who no doubt
envy them, and tradesmen who would not hesitate
to give them credit—&#8203;big credit—&#8203;unlimited credit.
Fools, oh, what fools there are! Was it not Thackeray
who wrote that ‘long customs, a manly appearance,
faultless boots and clothes and a happy fierceness
of manner’ would often help a man as much
as a great balance at his bankers?”</p>

<p>“How true!” he went on murmuring to himself.
“Here in London a man or a woman need only dress
in the height of fashion in clothes they never pay for,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>and hire a big car and pretend they own it, and be
seen in good society, and the world bows down before
them and craves to do them homage. Look at
Stapleton and that young ass Archie La Planta, and
a dozen others—&#8203;to say nothing of Jessica.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Jessica!”</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER <abbr title="Twelve">XII.</abbr>
</h3>
<h4>YOOTHA’S PRESENTIMENT.
</h4>
</div>


<p>Meanwhile Yootha Hagerston was secretly becoming
more and more enamored of Captain Preston.
It was the first time in her life she had ever
really cared for any man; until now she had followed
the fashion prevalent among many women of pretending
to consider love and deep affection “all nonsense”
and the hall-mark of a weak intelligence.
She had come to know his movements and had discovered
some of his haunts, with the result that she
rarely missed an opportunity of meeting him “by
chance.”</p>

<p>And, though he would not have admitted it, even
to himself, Preston had for some weeks past been singularly
attracted by Yootha. He had liked her that
day he had met her for the first time, at lunch at the
Ritz and afterwards at Jessica’s musical At Home,
though the woman who had most interested him
then had been Yootha’s friend, Cora Hartsilver. But
now it was different. There was something about the
girl, apart from her looks, which appealed to him.
What it was he could not have explained. It might
have been her sympathetic nature, or her personality,
or her temperament; in any case he felt strangely
drawn towards her every time they met.</p>

<p>On the lovely July afternoon Levi Schomberg had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>called to see Jessica and Stapleton, and had afterwards
wandered into the Park, Yootha was on the
river with Preston. A friend of his whose home was
at Pangbourne had, he had told her, on being suddenly
ordered abroad, told him he could, during his
absence, make use of his punt if ever he felt inclined
to; though Preston had himself just rented a house-boat
which was moored close to Maidenhead. Until
now he had not felt inclined; punting alone is a dull
form of amusement, and Preston had comparatively
few friends in London. Then one day, while thinking
of Yootha, the idea had occurred to him that she
might like a river picnic from time to time, and he
had hinted as much to her; Pangbourne was more
solitary than Maidenhead he reflected.</p>

<p>They were in a narrow estuary—&#8203;it was not a
backwater—&#8203;with the punt moored to a tree, and
for some moments neither had spoken. No sound,
save of birds singing in the woods around, broke
the almost perfect stillness. The air was sultry,
as though thunder were in the air.</p>

<p>“How fortunate I should have accepted La
Planta’s invitation to lunch at the Ritz that day
last August,” Preston said suddenly. “I did not
want to lunch with him, I remember, but now I am
glad I did.”</p>

<p>“Why are you glad?” she asked, looking across
at him. She was lying in the stern, propped up
with cushions, and made a pretty picture in her
big hat and the becoming boating frock which revealed
her figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
He gazed at her without answering. Then, as if
to conceal his embarrassment, he began to light his
briar.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” he replied awkwardly, tossing
the match into the water. “That was the first time
I met you, if you remember.”</p>

<p>If she remembered! Could she ever forget? That
was the thought which flashed into her brain,
but she did not utter it. Instead, she said carelessly:</p>

<p>“So it was. And the first time you met Jessica,
too, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>He made an impatient movement.</p>

<p>“Please don’t remind me of that. Every time I
think of that woman I feel positively vicious.”</p>

<p>“I thought that day,” Yootha continued, after a
pause, “that you had eyes for nobody but Cora.
You do like Cora, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Of course I like her, though not, perhaps, as
much as you like her. Nobody could help liking
her—&#8203;nobody who counts.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you say that. In my opinion she
is the one woman in the world. I simply worship
her, and always have. She is so true, so absolutely
free from insincerity. You never met her husband,
I think?”</p>

<p>“No—&#8203;fortunately.”</p>

<p>“Why fortunately?”</p>

<p>“From what I have heard about him he must
have been a terrible outsider. Was she very unhappy
with him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
“Very. They ought never to have married. Myself,
I hated him. He was so selfish, so self-satisfied,
in short such a bounder. I ought not, I suppose,
to say that of a dead man, but I can’t help it. He
was odious. I know you would have thought so
had you known him.”</p>

<p>Preston went on sucking at his pipe for some
moments, without speaking. Presently his eyes met
Yootha’s. He tried to look away, but could not.
And then, all at once, the girl gave a curious little
laugh. It was so unlike her to laugh apparently
at nothing, that Preston laughed too.</p>

<p>“What are we both laughing at?” she exclaimed,
suddenly recovering. She had colored unexpectedly,
and Preston noticed that the hand which hung
over the side of the punt trembled.</p>

<p>“I can’t think,” he said. “I fancy I was laughing
because I feel so happy.”</p>

<p>“Do you really,” she asked, and he saw that
her chest rose and fell beneath the flimsy material
she wore. “I wonder why?”</p>

<p>“Your cigarette had gone out,” he remarked inconsequently.
“Try one of mine. I think you will
like them.”</p>

<p>He stood up in the punt, and, balancing himself
carefully, stepped over to where she lay. Then,
kneeling beside her, he held out the case which he
had produced from his pocket.</p>

<p>He sat close to her when he had lit her cigarette.
Somehow her proximity seemed to agitate him. He
wanted to speak, to go on conversing on ordinary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>topics, as they had been, but words refused to
come.</p>

<p>And at that instant a drop of rain splashed upon
the punt. Without their noticing it the sky had
become overcast. Heavy drops followed in quick
succession, and then, without warning, a flash almost
blinded them, and on the same instant a peal of
thunder crackled overhead and all around them
like rifle fire.</p>

<p>When they had set out, early in the afternoon,
the sky had been cloudless, so that neither had coats
or wraps. Just in time Preston snatched up his
jacket and flung it over Yootha, a moment later
rain came down like a shower in the tropics.</p>

<p>Pulling the punt in closer under the bank to get
what shelter was obtainable, Preston looked down
anxiously at his companion to whom his thin jacket
afforded but scant protection. She was smiling
up at him and looked perfectly contented, save for
her anxiety about his getting drenched.</p>

<p>And still the rain poured down. Judging by the
sky, it was not going to stop very soon. Flash
after flash lit up the surrounding fields, and the
thunder pealed almost incessantly. And then all at
once, to add to their discomfort, wind began to rise.</p>

<p>That storm, as some may remember, was said
to be the worst London had known for twenty years.
It lasted throughout the night and well on into
the following morning, wreaking havoc in the metropolis
and in the provinces, and particularly up
the Thames valley.</p>

<p>And it was a storm which Preston and Yootha
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>Hagerston are not likely to forget, for it broke down
the barrier of reserve between them so effectually
that by the time they got home that evening in a
car—&#8203;which Preston with great difficulty succeeded
in chartering—&#8203;they were to all intents engaged.</p>

<p>Thinking over, next day, the events of the previous
afternoon, Preston smiled at the thought of all that
had occurred. Had anybody told him in the morning
that within four-and-twenty hours he would be
engaged to be married, he could have laughed the
speaker to scorn. Yet, as so often happens, the
seemingly impossible had come about, and he began
seriously to review the situation.</p>

<p>Yes, he was happy. Very happy. Of that he
felt convinced. Often in his time he had met a
girl with whom he thought he might be happy should
she consent to become his wife, but he had never
felt sufficiently sure of himself to propose. And
now he thanked heaven for that diffidence, for he
knew the only woman in the world he had ever
really wanted as a wife was Yootha Hagerston.</p>

<p>They did not meet again until the following afternoon.
He had telephoned about noon to ask if she
would have tea with him at his rooms in Fig Tree
Court, and her reply was what might have been
expected.</p>

<p>“My darling,” he exclaimed, folding her in his
arms and pressing her lips to his as they met in
the little passage which his servant called “the
hall.” “If you knew how happy you have made me,
how I now realize that for weeks past I have wanted
you to become mine—&#8203;mine for ever—&#8203;—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
He stopped, for she was sobbing, clinging to him
as though she could never let him go.</p>

<p>“What is it? What is the matter?” he exclaimed
in alarm, raising her face from his shoulder and
trying to look into her eyes. “Why are you crying,
Yootha?”</p>

<p>And then, all at once, he realized that her tears
were tears of happiness.</p>

<p>“Only one thing makes me anxious, Charlie,”
she said later, after tea, “and that is that something
may come between us—&#8203;and prevent our marriage.
I don’t know why, but I have a presentiment, a
sort of feeling—&#8203;oh, I can’t explain, I don’t know
what it is, I hardly know what I am saying I feel
so happy, so absolutely and perfectly happy. But
can we hurry on the wedding, dearest? Couldn’t
we be married by special license, or something. I
don’t want to wait a day longer, not an hour longer
than is absolutely necessary. Life is so uncertain,
you know, and such strange and unlooked-for things
sometimes happen. Tell me, Charlie, must we go
to the ball Thursday night?”</p>

<p>“At the Albert Hall? I am afraid I must, darling,
because I have made up a party, as you know.
Don’t you want to go? I thought you were looking
forward to it.”</p>

<p>“I was, but now I would rather not go. Still, if
you must go, of course, I’ll come with you. But I
shall be glad when it is over. I can’t think why,
but the thought of that ball now seems somehow
to frighten me. It didn’t until we became engaged.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
But Preston soon dispelled her fancies. She was
excited, he said, unstrung. “What could happen
to anybody at a ball at the Albert Hall?” he exclaimed,
laughing. He had been in hotter places
in France and had come through all right—&#8203;except
for that bit of shrapnel in his leg. Yes, he agreed
with her that it would be best for the news of their
engagement not to be announced until her parents
had been informed.</p>

<p>“How do you think they will take it?” he asked.
“Will they be pleased, or not?”</p>

<p>“Probably not,” she answered lightly. “At least,
if they are pleased, it will be the first time they
have ever approved of anything I have done on my
own initiative. And then there is the question of
money. I have a small income of my own, as you
know, and lately I inherited a comfortable little
nest egg, and my stepmother naturally hopes that
in the ordinary course of events I may some day
make over some of my capital to her and to my
father. Our marriage will dispel that delusion,” and
she laughed.</p>

<p>“You say naturally,” Preston said, “but I think
it most unnatural she should think anything of the
sort.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you don’t know my stepmother. But let
us change the subject. Whenever I begin to think
about my stepmother something unpleasant is sure
to happen. Don’t think me superstitious. I am not,
as a rule, but on that point I am extremely superstitious,
because what I say has often happened.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
As they came out into Fleet Street, a little later,
they met Hopford hurrying to his office.</p>

<p>“Sorry I can’t wait,” he said, “but I’ve got hold
of something rather good to-day, something which
will interest you both, by the way, and I have to
write the story before seven. See you at the ball
on Thursday, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“You have promised to have supper with us
there,” Preston said with a laugh.</p>

<p>“So I have! I shouldn’t have forgotten it on
Thursday night, you may be sure. It ought to be a
festive evening.”</p>

<p>He raised his hat and turned down Whitefriars
Street, and Preston looked about for a taxi. But
there was not one to be seen which was disengaged.</p>

<p>Presently he glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>“I have to meet a man in Bloomsbury at six
o’clock,” he said, “and it is now half-past five.
Would you care to walk that far with me, darling?”</p>

<p>She answered that she would “adore to,” and so
it came about that, on turning out of Russell Square,
Preston pointed out a house to her on the opposite
side of the street.</p>

<p>“That is a house you must often have heard
about,” he said. “They call it the house with the
bronze face. It is the headquarters of the famous
Metropolitan Secret Agency.”</p>

<p>Yootha looked across at it with interest.</p>

<p>“What a horrible knocker!” she exclaimed. “Isn’t
the face awful? I have heard Cora and the others
speak about the place. She went there recently,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>as you know, to try to find out about Jessica, and
she expects to hear soon. She described the knocker
to me then. No wonder it has given the house a
curious reputation—&#8203;I mean the stories that are
told about it. But they are all nonsense, I suppose?”
she ended, looking at Preston.</p>

<p>“Of course they must be, though the fact that
Lord Froissart called there on the morning of the
day he committed suicide has probably given the
tales about the house a fresh lease of life. I can’t
stand superstitious people, can you? I am glad
you are not superstitious, dearest.”</p>

<p>Yootha laughed uneasily.</p>

<p>“It’s a gloomy, depressing-looking house, anyway,”
she said, changing the subject as she glanced
back at the door. “And it has a mysterious look.
But I think a detective agency always sounds mysterious.”</p>

<p>“The people who run the Secret Agency must be
extraordinarily clever,” Preston said. “The number
of criminals they have brought to book is said to
be very large, though the agency has not been in
existence many years. I heard a rumor some days
ago that they are now hot on the scent of the thieves
who stole Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson’s jewels out
of her safe during one of her evening parties.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Hopford seems to be very interested in
that affair,” Yootha observed. “Now, I wonder if
he had heard anything about it when we met him
in Fleet Street? He said what he was going to
write would be of interest to us both.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
They had now arrived at the house where Preston
had an appointment. An empty taxi was passing,
and he hailed it.</p>

<p>“Then we shall meet Thursday night,” he said,
when he had handed Yootha into the taxi and shut
the door. “Cora is going to call for me in her car
at ten o’clock, and we shall pick you up on our
way to the ball.”</p>

<h4>BOX NUMBER THIRTEEN.
</h4>
</div>

<p>Of all the balls that have been given at Albert Hall
within the past ten or twelve years, none has approached
in its splendor, or in the luxury of its
appointment and setting “the pageant worthy of
Ancient Rome,” as some of the newspapers termed
it, which took place in July, 1919.</p>

<p>The whole of the interior of the vast building
had been painted and decorated in an amazingly
artistic manner, and utterly regardless of expense.
All the seasons were presented in turn in a gigantic
panorama, which depicted also the most daring love
scenes described in the well-known classics. True,
a few London journals and many provincial papers
clamored to know why so huge a sum should have
been spent on “decking out” one great ball-room,
seeing that the ball had been organized “ostensibly
in aid of charity,” but the cavillers received no
answer. Heckled on the point by a Parliamentary
representative of advanced Socialistic views, Stapleton
calmly replied that “if you set out to make
money you must spend money to make it,” an
argument which proved its soundness when the accounts
came to be totaled up and an enormous sum
was handed to charity.</p>

<p>Long before the night every ticket had been sold.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>Nor could another be obtained for love or money.
By midnight the immense circle of boxes sparkled
with a blaze of diamonds, worn, on that occasion,
not by decrepit dowagers, as is the case so often
at the Opera, but for the most part by young and
extremely beautiful women. Indeed, it was safe
to say that literally everybody who was anybody
attended at the Albert Hall that night, though as
the faces of all were concealed by masks which
they were at liberty to wear throughout the night
if so inclined, even detectives would have been unable
to say who was present and who absent had
they been ordered to make a report.</p>

<p>Preston’s party, which included Cora Hartsilver
and Yootha Hagerston, Harry Hopford, George
Blenkiron, and about a dozen more, occupied a box
only six boxes away from Jessica Mervyn-Robertson’s.
Her party, too, numbered about a dozen,
and her first appearance in the hall created a sensation
which few present that night are likely to forget.</p>

<p>Her dress! In the first place, of what did it consist?
Certainly of very little, but that little—&#8203;—</p>

<p>A great mottled snake with enormous eyes which,
as the rays of the electroliers caught them, assumed
chameleon tints, becoming now a jet black, now a
sea green blending into different shades, now golden
copper, now blood red....</p>

<p>That was the impression which first struck the
beholder as Jessica came towards him.</p>

<p>In reality the “gown” was a mottled skin which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>fitted like a glove, and from a distance conveyed
the impression that it was covered with real scales.
But a closer inspection showed that the skin ended
half-way up the chest and back, the “scales” design
being continued on the bare flesh and painted thereon
so marvelously that where skin ended and flesh
began could be discerned only with difficulty. The
great chameleon eyes which at first riveted the attention
of all beholders were on the mask itself,
which hid her face entirely, and exactly resembled
the head of a giant puff adder. Indeed, Jessica’s
costume, if costume it could be called, was by far
the most bizarre in the whole of that vast assemblage,
where weird and decadent gowns were
plentiful enough.</p>

<p>“Who can the woman with that horrible snake
costume and the extraordinary eyes be?” Yootha
said as she leaned forward in Preston’s box and
scanned the astonishing vision through her opera
glasses. “Have you ever seen anything more abominable,
Charlie?”</p>

<p>“A good many of the dresses here are abominable,
in my opinion,” Preston answered, “and plenty of
the men’s costumes might with advantage have
been scrapped. Look at that creature over there
with nothing on, apparently, but a woman’s silk
swimming suit. I wonder what he did during the
war, or if he did anything?”</p>

<p>“You do harp on that, Charlie,” Yootha said
almost impatiently. “After all, the war is over,
so what does it matter what people wear at a costume
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>ball, so long as their costumes are not obviously
indecent or decadent, like that woman’s snake skin.
Look, she is coming towards us.”</p>

<p>Escorted by male companions, the mottled snake
approached. They were close to Preston’s box now,
and as they passed they walked more slowly and
stared up through their masks apparently straight
at his party. A little shudder ran through Yootha.
Why, she did not know, and as it did so the horrible
chameleon eyes turned from copper to deep crimson.</p>

<p>“I must, at any cost, find out who that is,”
Hopford murmured. “I already have my suspicion;
the attitude that tall man with her is standing in
now is quite familiar.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do find out,” Yootha exclaimed. “I am dying
to know. Why, they have that box close to ours,”
she added as Jessica and her companions joined
the remainder of their party. “The box attendant
will surely be able to tell you, Mr. Hopford.”</p>

<p>“The little man at the back is unmistakable,
anyhow,” Hopford said as he kept his eyes riveted
on the party. “Twenty masks couldn’t disguise
him! It’s Levi Schomberg, the Jew moneylender,
who is said to lend thousands to all the ‘best’ people
in Society, cabinet ministers not excepted. There
shouldn’t be much difficulty in finding out now,”
and rising, he excused himself and left the box.</p>

<p>He soon found the attendant of the box occupied
by Jessica and her party, and, having slipped some
money into the man’s hand he asked him if he
would tell Mr. Levi Schomberg that he was wanted.</p>

<p>“And who shall I say, sir?” the attendant inquired,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>looking into the eyes which fixed him through
the mask.</p>

<p>“Say a ‘gentleman,’ and that it is important.”</p>

<p>In a minute the attendant returned, accompanied
by the little Jew who, dressed as a troubadour, presented
a far more grotesque figure than he supposed.</p>

<p>“Yes?” he said as he came up. “You wish to speak
to me? Who are you?”</p>

<p>He had not removed his mask, and the little black
eyes seemed to burn with curiosity behind it.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to disturb you,” Hopford said, “but
<cite>The Evening Herald</cite> wants to know if it would be
possible to obtain a flashlight photograph of Mrs.
Mervyn-Robertson in the striking gown she is wearing
to-night.”</p>

<p>Schomberg snorted.</p>

<p>“I am certain,” he answered, “that Mrs. Robertson
would not consent to be photographed by the
<cite>Evening Herald</cite> or any other paper, so it would be
useless for me to ask her.”</p>

<p>He was about to turn away, when he checked
himself.</p>

<p>“Why did you ask for me instead of for Mrs.
Robertson?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p>Hopford laughed.</p>

<p>“I leave that conundrum to you to answer,” he
said. “Good night, Mr. Schomberg,” and he went
off elated at his success, while the Jew stood looking
after him with a scowl which his mask concealed.</p>

<p>Hopford had suspected from the first the identity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>of the “snake woman,” as people now called her;
the dress was being greatly talked about. Now he
would be able to enlighten Yootha Hagerston; also
in his paper next day he would, he told himself,
boldly name the wearer of the very daring costume.</p>

<p>As the night wore on, the noise and merriment
increased. Certainly no Albert Hall ball had ever
been less decorous. The most modern and the most
peculiar dances followed one another in quick succession.
Yet though the floor looked packed it was
not unduly crowded.</p>

<p>Blenkiron stood apart with his friend, Captain
Preston, whose wounded leg precluded his dancing.</p>

<p>“I should like to possess a sum equivalent to a
year’s interest on the value of all the diamonds and
other jewelry here to-night,” he said lightly. “It
would set some of us up for life!”</p>

<p>“And the war was supposed to have impoverished
the nation!” Preston observed dryly. “This sort
of show isn’t much in my line, George.”</p>

<p>“Or in mine. But Cora is enjoying it, and Yootha
too. Smart of Hopford to have discovered the
identity of the woman in the snake costume—&#8203;eh?
I bet she’ll be annoyed when she sees her name
in his paper to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“You think so? Why?”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow, would any woman with the
least self-respect not be ashamed to let it be known
she wore a dress like that in public?”</p>

<p>“A woman with the least self-respect—&#8203;yes. But
has Jessica the least self-respect?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
“Well, we know nothing against her, do we? We
only think we have reason to suspect she may not
be—&#8203;well, all she poses to be. Queer her entertaining
that Jew moneylender, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“She may have a reason.”</p>

<p>“A woman with her income!”</p>

<p>“How do we know what her income is? Plenty
of people with no money at all spend recklessly.
She may be up to her ears in debt, and her friend
Stapleton, too. The slim man talking to Stapleton
is, I suppose, La Planta.”</p>

<p>They looked in the direction where two men,
masked like the rest, were engaged in earnest conversation.</p>

<p>“I have not yet overcome my aversion from that
young man,” Preston said as he watched them.
“Every time I speak to him I feel he rings untrue.
Ah, here come Yootha and Harry.”</p>

<p>Yootha, flushed with the night’s excitement, had
probably never looked better. Her eyes shone with
pleasure, for Hopford was an excellent dancer. It
was nearly two in the morning now, and the revels
were at their height.</p>

<p>Presently the band struck up the newest Jazz, a
wild combination of almost every sound capable of
being produced by musical and unmusical instruments,
a sort of savage discord in many keys which
clashed and blared to the accompaniment of human
cries and trombone laughter. Carried away by
what passed for music, the dancers who now
thronged the floor performed the strangest evolutions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>Some, locked in a close embrace, seemed
oblivious of all but their own emotions as they
gyrated in never-ending circles; others, barely
touching, went through contortions which in any
other place and under any other circumstances would
have shocked some beholders, filled some with disgust,
and convulsed the remainder with amusement.</p>

<p>It was in the middle of this performance that a
strange thing occurred. Happening to look in the
direction of Jessica’s box, now temporarily deserted,
Preston noticed two men in it. One he quickly
recognized by his costume to be Levi Schomberg;
the other....</p>

<p>“George,” he said, turning to Blenkiron, “that
thin man bending over Levi Schomberg—&#8203;the fellow
dressed as a troubadour we decided must be Schomberg,
didn’t we?—is that La Planta, do you think?”</p>

<p>Blenkiron looked in the direction indicated.</p>

<p>“Hopford declared him to be La Planta,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, what is he doing—&#8203;I mean Schomberg,
the man sitting down?”</p>

<p>Blenkiron watched him for some moments.</p>

<p>“He’s drunk, I should say,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Drunk! Not a bit of it. Look at his attitude.”</p>

<p>“It certainly is queer. Ah, La Planta has left
him now. He is going out of the box. I can see
Jessica outside waiting for him.”</p>

<p>As Blenkiron stopped speaking, the man whom
they believed to be La Planta, accompanied now
by the mottled snake, walked quickly into the corridor
behind the boxes, and were lost to sight.</p>

<p>Levi Schomberg, meanwhile, remained seated in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>the box. Bent forward, and resting against the
velvet balustrade, he appeared to be gazing at the
crowded floor. None noticed him, apparently, but
Preston and George Blenkiron, whose complete attention
he now held.</p>

<p>“Strange,” Blenkiron said at last, “how motionless
he is. He has not stirred for fully five minutes.”</p>

<p>They went on looking. When some more minutes
had passed, and the figure still remained motionless,
Preston linked his friend’s arm in his own.</p>

<p>“Let us go and see if he is ill,” he said. “I
am sure something is amiss with him.”</p>

<p>They went up the staircase and round to the
back of the boxes until they reached the box they
sought. The door was shut. After knocking several
times, and receiving no answer, they went in search
of the attendant.</p>

<p>“There is a gentleman alone in Box Thirteen,”
Preston said, “who appears to be ill. We have
knocked repeatedly, but can get no reply.”</p>

<p>“A friend of yours?” the attendant inquired.</p>

<p>“We know him, yes.”</p>

<p>The Jazz band was blaring still as Preston and
Blenkiron passed into the box, closely followed by
the attendant. They spoke Schomberg’s name, but
he did not reply. Then they went over to him, and
Blenkiron put a hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>Still he made no response. Now thoroughly on
the alert Preston stripped off Schomberg’s mask,
then jumped back with a start.</p>

<p>To all it was at once obvious that the little Hebrew
was dead!</p>

CHAPTER <abbr title="Fourteen">XIV.</abbr>
</h3>
<h4>CONCERNS A NECKLACE.
</h4>
</div>

<p>“Look at that drunken ass being carried out of his
box.”</p>

<p>The speaker stood beside his partner on the
floor of the hall, fanning her with an ostrich plume.</p>

<p>The girl laughed.</p>

<p>“Why can’t you men keep sober?” she said,
only partly in jest. They remained watching Levi
and those assisting him until the group passed out
of the box and was lost to sight.</p>

<p>Others had watched him too, and because the
conclusion they had all jumped at was that the
fellow, whoever he might be, had drunk too much,
the incident of his sudden death caused no commotion,
and the ball went on as gaily as though
nothing untoward had occurred.</p>

<p>Stretched on a sofa in the secretary’s office,
Schomberg lay strangely stiff, seeing that he could
not have been dead over half an hour. A doctor
had been discovered among the dancers, and, dressed
to resemble a well-known comedian, he presented a
ludicrous figure as he bent over the dead man,
listening through his stethoscope. Presently he
straightened himself and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Quite dead,” he said. “Who is he? Does anybody
know anything about him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
He looked about at the various people standing
by.</p>

<p>“It’s Levi Schomberg,” Preston said. “He was
one of Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson’s guests. It was her
box we found him in.”</p>

<p>“Mervyn-Robertson? You mean the woman they
call Jessica?” the doctor asked with a curious look.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“May I ask if she is a friend of yours?”</p>

<p>“I know her to speak to,” Preston answered,
“so does my friend here, but I can’t say she is a
friend of ours. To what do you attribute death,
doctor?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say at off-hand. Heart, most likely;
the heat and general excitement may have induced
the final attack. We must communicate with his
friends. Are they here?”</p>

<p>“I believe so. I don’t know Schomberg myself.”</p>

<p>“I thought the attendant said you were both
friends of his.”</p>

<p>“We told the attendant we knew him, to get into
the box. We could see from the hall that something
was amiss with him.”</p>

<p>“How could you? Hadn’t he a mask on?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we had discovered his identity early in
the evening.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? You will forgive my asking, but what
made you take so much interest in this man whom
you say you knew only by sight?”</p>

<p>Preston hesitated. Then he said awkwardly:</p>

<p>“Nothing in particular.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
“Oh, come,” the doctor exclaimed, “you must
have had a reason. Nobody tries to discover who
disguised people are for no reason. You had better
tell me.”</p>

<p>“Why do you want to know?”</p>

<p>“Well, as you put it that way, I had better tell
you there are one or two curious features surrounding
this man’s death. On the face of it he would
appear to have died of natural causes, but certain
points tend to dispel that theory. For instance,
<i lang="la">rigor mortis</i> would not have set in so quickly had
death been due to natural causes, such as stoppage
of the heart’s action. There will have to be an inquest.”</p>

<p>The authorities having been notified of the
occurrence, about half an hour later Preston and
Blenkiron, accompanied by the doctor, whose name
was Johnson, returned to the hall. None of the
revelers had as yet left, apparently, for the floor
was as thronged with dancers as when they had
been there last.</p>

<p>“Point me out the box where he was found, will
you?” Johnson said presently.</p>

<p>“That is the one,” Blenkiron replied, indicating
it, “next to the box with the woman with scarlet
plumes.”</p>

<p>“There are people in it now,” Johnson observed.
“Do you know who they are? Why, one of them
is that snake woman everybody has been talking
about.”</p>

<p>“We are under the impression, though we don’t
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>know for certain,” Preston replied guardedly, “that
the snake woman is Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson herself,
and that the man talking to her is called Stapleton.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean Aloysius Stapleton, the organizer
of this ball?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, if Schomberg was one of their party they
apparently have not heard what has happened, and
somebody ought to tell them.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t you better tell them, Doctor Johnson?”</p>

<p>“I suppose I must. And as you and your friend
rendered ‘first aid’ you had better come with me
to confirm my statements.”</p>

<p>Jessica and the woman and the three men with
them still wore their masks, though some of the
dancers had now discarded theirs. When Doctor
Johnson and his companions were admitted to the
box, Jessica and her friends were in the highest
spirits. Jessica herself was laughing loudly, while
two of the men had become uproarious. The doctor
had sent in his card and asked if he might speak
to Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson alone, but she had
sent out word that he had better come into the
box.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson, I believe?” he said,
addressing her.</p>

<p>“Now, who told you that, Doctor Johnson?”
she exclaimed, still laughing, and her friends laughed
too. “All night I have tried to retain my incognita,
but people one after another have penetrated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>it. Sit down and have some champagne, won’t you?”
and she pushed a chair towards him. He saw
at once that she herself had drunk as much champagne
as was good for her.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much,” he said, “but I won’t,
if you will excuse me. I would sooner have said
in private, Mrs. Robertson, what I have to tell
you, but as you have insisted on my coming in I
must tell it to you here. One of your guests to-night
was, I believe, a Mr. Schomberg?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered. “Why, what has become
of him?” she added, looking round. “We have
not seen him for quite a long time. Mr. Johnson
you might introduce your friends,” as Preston and
Blenkiron still stood in the background.</p>

<p>“I will in a moment. But first I have some
rather dreadful news to break to you, Mrs. Robertson.
You must brace yourself for a shock. Mr.
Schomberg has died suddenly. He died here, in
this box, less than an hour ago.”</p>

<p>At once everybody grew solemn. The party became
hushed.</p>

<p>“Levi—&#8203;<em>dead</em>!” Jessica gasped after a pause. “It
is impossible. He was here only just now, and quite
well!”</p>

<p>“An hour ago,” Johnson corrected. “I was sent
for, and I found Mr. Schomberg lying on the sofa
in the secretary’s office, dead.”</p>

<p>“But where did he die? And who found him?”</p>

<p>“As I say, he died in this box, where he was found
by these two gentlemen, whom I think you know,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>and he turned to the masked figures at his elbow,
“Mr. Blenkiron and Captain Preston.”</p>

<p>As his name was mentioned, it struck Preston
that Jessica gave a little start. He told Blenkiron
afterwards, however, that he could have sworn she
did.</p>

<p>Jessica bowed.</p>

<p>“But how did you come to be in this box?”
she asked, looking up at them from where she
sat.</p>

<p>“I must apologize for our having intruded, Mrs.
Robertson,” Preston said, “but how it happened
was this,” and he went on to explain how he and
Blenkiron, noticing that the masked man sitting
alone in her box appeared to be unwell, had obtained
admittance to the box.</p>

<p>“That was most kind of you,” Jessica said when
he stopped speaking. “But really this news is too
terrible. I can’t realize it. Poor Levi! And he
seemed so well to-night, and in such excellent
spirits.”</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>“I wonder who it was sent in to see him early
in the evening?” she said after a pause. “He
seemed put out when he came back, and didn’t
volunteer to tell anybody what was amiss, so of
course I couldn’t ask him. But he got all right
again a little later.”</p>

<p>“That would hardly have any bearing on the
cause of death, Mrs. Robertson.”</p>

<p>It was Johnson who spoke. He was looking hard
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>at her through the holes in his mask. Apparently
through forgetfulness he had not taken it off.</p>

<p>“No, of course it wouldn’t,” Jessica answered
mechanically. Her thoughts seemed to be far away.
“Tell me, Doctor Johnson,” she said suddenly, in a
different tone, “to what cause do you attribute his
sudden death?”</p>

<p>“At first I attributed it to natural causes, but
afterwards I changed my opinion,” he replied in
measured tones.</p>

<p>He was still looking hard at her.</p>

<p>“And what made you change your opinion?”</p>

<p>“One or two things which would take too long
to explain. No doubt the actual cause will be
arrived at during the inquest.”</p>

<p>“There will be an inquest, then?”</p>

<p>Preston fancied her voice trembled a little.</p>

<p>“In the circumstances there will have to be.”</p>

<p>“You mean you think he took his life—&#8203;and by
poison?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Mrs. Robertson, you mistake me. But
there is no need to go further into the matter now.
You would like, I dare say, to view the body
presently.”</p>

<p>“Must I?”</p>

<p>“Certainly not, unless you wish to. I thought
perhaps you might wish to.”</p>

<p>“I would much sooner not. The whole thing
has upset me terribly, as I am sure it has upset
us all.”</p>

<p>She leant forward, poured herself out a glass of
champagne, and emptied the glass at a draught.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
“Captain Preston and Mr. Blenkiron,” she said,
“do help yourselves, and you too, Doctor Johnson.
I am sure this affair must have given you all a
shock.”</p>

<p>Once more Preston and his friend were mingling
in the gay throng. Doctor Johnson had left them
after thanking them for their services and saying
they would no doubt be called to give evidence at
the inquest. A little group at one of the tables in
the big supper-room were talking in animated tones,
and Preston happened to overhear scraps of their
conversation.</p>

<p>“Yes, a woman has been arrested ... was arrested
ten minutes ago ... the pearls were found
in her possession. The man with her ... became
furiously indignant, declared he had been with her
all the night. Then she was confronted with the
owner of the necklace, who swore she had sat beside
her at supper ... the thief, or alleged thief,
is quite a girl ... yes, I was standing by when they
took her mask off....”</p>

<p>“Who is she? Have you any idea?” somebody
asked.</p>

<p>“None at all. You can stake your life though,
that at a show of this sort there are bound to be
professional crooks about. Look at the diamonds
here to-night! They must run into fortunes and
fortunes. Well, here’s luck to us all, and I
hope....”</p>

<p>That was as much as Preston heard and it did
not interest him greatly. Since leaving Jessica’s
box he had been looking for Yootha, whom he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>seen last with Cora Hartsilver. But their box was
now empty, from which he concluded they were all
dancing. Hopford, too, he had not come across
for some time. Preston knew that Hopford and
Yootha were engaged for several dances.</p>

<p>In the crowd Preston had lost sight of Blenkiron,
and he now threaded his way alone and aimlessly
through the little groups of dancers clustered together
and resting. The band had become more riotous
than ever, the dancing more extravagant and
grotesque. And all the while, as he made his way
along, he kept thinking of Schomberg and his
strange death. Again he saw the masked young
man stooping over the seated figure bent forward
in the box and apparently leaning against it. The
figure had not moved then, neither had it moved
during the minutes which elapsed before he and
Blenkiron had gone up to the box to ascertain if
anything were amiss. Could Schomberg already
have been dead when the slim man stood bending
over him? If so, then why had the latter not sent
for a doctor, or raised the alarm?</p>

<p>And that slim young man, according to Hopford,
had been La Planta. Perhaps, though, Hopford
had been mistaken. Then he thought of Jessica.
How surprised and distressed she had appeared to
be when Doctor Johnson had broken to her the
news of Schomberg’s death. That she should be
was, of course, only natural in the circumstances,
and yet—&#8203;—</p>

<p>What had become of Yootha? Where in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>world had she got to? And Cora, too, and Hopford?
Perhaps Hopford had gone back to the
office of his newspaper; he had said he might have
to go.</p>

<p>In vain he watched the dancers—&#8203;swaying, revolving,
always revolving, until the scene made him
dizzy. But he saw no sign of Yootha, or of any
of his party. At intervals he glanced at the box
they had occupied, but it remained empty. He was
getting sick of the whole thing, and longed to get
back home. But he could not go home without
first seeing Yootha. He felt he had seen less of
her that evening than he had hoped to do; but
then she loved dancing, and he would, he told himself,
have been a bear to prevent her dancing because
himself unable, owing to his wounded leg, to
dance at all.</p>

<p>Suddenly his spirits rose. He had caught sight
of Hopford ... he was some way off.... Ah,
there he was again! Wandering, he appeared to be
in search of some one. And at that instant Hopford
saw him.</p>

<p>“Charlie, for heaven’s sake—&#8203;I have been hunting
for you everywhere,” Hopford exclaimed when at
last they came together. “An awful thing has
happened—&#8203;it will give you a big shock, but I
implore you not to worry, because I am positive
all will come right in the end. Cora knows about
it and is with Yootha now.”</p>

<p>“Yootha? Where is she, Harry? I have been
trying to find her for the last half an hour or more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
“I can well believe that,” Hopford answered.
“Now listen, Charlie, and don’t get upset. A woman
had her pearl necklace stolen to-night, and the necklace
has been found in Yootha’s vanity bag, and
so—&#8203;well, of course they had to arrest her.”</p>

<p>“Arrest her! <em>Arrest Yootha?</em>”</p>

<p>“Why yes. You see the pearls were found in
her possession. Have you heard about Levi Schomberg,
and—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>“Hang Levi Schomberg!” Preston cried out.
“What the devil does Levi Schomberg matter—&#8203;forgive
me, Harry, here, take me to Yootha at once and
let me see the police myself about this ridiculous
trumped-up charge!”</p>

CHAPTER <abbr title="Fifteen">XV.</abbr>
</h3>
<h4>SOME CROOKED QUESTIONS.
</h4>
</div>

<p>During the week which followed the papers gave
special prominence to two items of news which
interested their readers greatly. One was the strange
death of Levi Schomberg, with an account of events
which had immediately preceded it, and a record
of his past career; the other was the arrest of Yootha
Hagerston on a charge of stealing a pearl necklace
owned by a woman named Marietta Stringborg,
wife of Julius Stringborg, described as “formerly of
Shanghai, spirit merchant, but now of Upper Bruton
Street, London, and The Retreat, Maidenhead.”</p>

<p>Schomberg’s death, it seemed, was of rather a
mysterious character, and the inquest lasted a considerable
time. In the opinion of the coroner it
had been due to natural causes, but Doctor Johnson
strongly opposed that theory and advanced several
significant points in his endeavor to disprove it.</p>

<p>First, there was the peculiarity of <i lang="la">de rigor mortis</i>
having set in so soon; then the fact that all the
organs were obviously healthy; then the singular
appearance of the eyes, which, the doctor declared,
had not resembled the eyes of a dead man when first
he had examined the body; and, lastly, the condition
of the blood. Very emphatically he maintained
that the blood had an unusual tint. This
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>might, he admitted, easily have been overlooked;
yet it undoubtedly existed, and he was at a loss
to account for it. He admitted that the condition
of the blood seemed healthy.</p>

<p>The coroner was one of those rather pig-headed
men, who, having expressed an opinion, are loth in
any circumstances to alter it. In any case, it was
obvious to Preston and Blenkiron from the first
that the coroner was not favorably disposed towards
Doctor Johnson, and that every suggestion the latter
made he endeavored to controvert.</p>

<p>“I confess,” he observed pompously, when Johnson
had pointed out very clearly why in his opinion
death had not been due to natural causes, “that
I completely fail to follow your line of argument.
Furthermore, what possible reason could any person
or persons have had for wishing to hasten the
death of so respectable a citizen as deceased appears
to have been, in spite of his unsavory calling?
In my opinion the idea that death was due to other
than natural causes is preposterous. Had the unfortunate
man taken poison, or had poison been
administered, traces of it must have been found.
As it is, no trace of any sort of poison has been discovered,
and therefore, if you will forgive my speaking
bluntly, Doctor Johnson, I consider that your
speculations are hypercritical—&#8203;or let us say beside
the mark.”</p>

<p>Johnson shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“In that case,” he replied, “I have nothing further
to say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
“Quite so. I am glad to hear you say that.”</p>

<p>Johnson opened his mouth as if about to speak
again; then changed his mind and remained silent.
“What is the use,” was his mental comment, “of
arguing with such a person?”</p>

<p>And so, after all, a verdict of “death from natural
causes” was returned, and Johnson, feeling extremely
dissatisfied, left the Court accompanied by Blenkiron
and Captain Preston.</p>

<p>It was the second of these two incidents, however,
which had interested Preston far more than the
first, had, indeed, engrossed almost the whole of
his attention since the night of the ball—&#8203;the arrest
of Yootha Hagerston. Though finally acquitted,
she had undergone intense mental suffering during
the time she had been kept under observation. And
naturally people had talked. Many, in fact, had
not yet finished talking. Among the latter was
Jessica Mervyn-Robertson.</p>

<p>Perhaps the truth of the old saying that “if you
throw mud enough, some of it is sure to stick,”
had never been better illustrated than in connection
with Yootha’s arrest on a charge of theft. Women
in particular discussed the affair, and during such
discussions eyebrows were raised significantly, and
there were plenty of little smiles which implied more
than any spoken words could have done.</p>

<p>“Had she been a poor woman, instead of what we
call a lady,” the hackneyed observation was trotted
out again, “she would be in prison now, my dear,”
a faded creature who had always toadied to rich
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>people observed to Jessica during a few moments’
conversation they had in Bond Street one morning.
“Mrs. Stringborg is a friend of yours, isn’t
she?”</p>

<p>Jessica replied that she had known her for some
years.</p>

<p>“And what does she think about it?”</p>

<p>Jessica raised her eyebrows. Then, after an instant’s
pause, she said cryptically:</p>

<p>“She doesn’t think.”</p>

<p>The faded woman nodded.</p>

<p>“I understand,” she purred. “She knows.”</p>

<p>Jessica smiled. It was one of the significant smiles
referred to, more deadly than spoken words.</p>

<p>And so they parted, Jessica with a smile upon
her lips, and hatred still in her heart, the other
woman reveling in her good fortune at having had
this assurance, as she chose to consider it, direct
from a friend of Marietta Stringborg’s, that though
Yootha had been acquitted she was guilty.</p>

<p>And Yootha?</p>

<p>Already she began to feel the draught in the
mental atmosphere. Plenty of her friends remained
true to her, of course, not giving a second thought
to the suggestion that the pearls had been taken
by her, but there were others....</p>

<p>Highly strung and extremely sensitive, she felt
the difference in the “atmosphere” at every turn.
The quick glances towards her and then away from
her; the glances followed by whispers, and the
whispers sometimes by smiles; the slight <i lang="fr">hauteur</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>of folk who up till then had greeted her always
with effusion; the sudden crossing from her side
of the street to the other by acquaintances who
noticed her approaching—&#8203;these and similar incidents
affected her intensely, causing acute pain.</p>

<p>“It is too dreadful,” she exclaimed one night on
her return with her friend, Cora Hartsilver, to the
latter’s house in Park Crescent after the Opera. “I
have been miserable to-night—&#8203;miserable. I felt
during the whole performance as if all the audience
was staring at me, saying one to another: ‘There
she is, that is the girl so much talked about who
was charged with the theft of the necklace at the
Albert Hall ball.’ And it was not all imagination,
dear, for I distinctly heard my name whispered
twice by people a row or two behind us. And then,
did you see Jessica? She saw me directly we entered
the theater, and I saw her turn in her box
and speak to her friends and at once they all gathered
nearer to hear what she had to say—&#8203;while we walked
down to our seats they all stared at me as hard as
they could.... I felt like a criminal, Cora. I
feel like a criminal still....” and throwing her
arms impetuously about her friend with her head
on her shoulder she began to cry bitterly.</p>

<p>Cora consoled her as best she could, while in
her own heart fury burned. It was fury at the
thought, at the conviction she felt, that this injustice
was not the outcome of misfortune, but that
the whole thing had been deliberately planned,
and that the person who had planned it had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>none other than Jessica. And why did Jessica hate
Yootha so? There could, she told herself be but
one reason—&#8203;it was because Yootha was her friend.
Jessica would, no doubt, have liked to cast suspicion
of the robbery on herself, but, unable to do that,
she had stabbed her through her friend. And, so
thinking, Cora ground her teeth. More determined
than ever did she become at that moment to find
out everything about Jessica Mervyn-Robertson, and
if possible shame her in the eyes of the world forever.</p>

<p>“Don’t cry, my darling,” she said, as she gently
stroked Yootha’s hair; Yootha’s arm still encircled
her. “I have had a letter to-night from the house
with the bronze face, and they are leaving no stone
unturned to run the thief to ground. They ask me
to call with you as soon as possible, as there are
certain further questions they wish to put to you.
Also, they say, they have something important to
show you.”</p>

<p>“Let us go to-morrow morning,” Yootha exclaimed,
looking up, and mopping her eyes. “And
we might take Charlie with us; he will come if we
ask him, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“I was about to suggest that,” Cora answered.
“We will ring him up now. He said he would be
back in town to-night, didn’t he? And it isn’t
midnight yet.”</p>

<p>But the telephone remained silent.</p>

<p>Consequently they went alone next morning to
the office of the Metropolitan Secret Agency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
The room into which they were shown was the
office where Alix Stothert and Madame Camille
Lenoir had been working late on the night Lord
Froissart had so unexpectedly made his appearance;
only now in the rooms adjoining many clerks were
at work, and typing machines clattered. Only
Stothert was in the room, and he looked up as they
entered. Then, as he rose, he removed the eyeshade
from his forehead.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” he said solemnly. “Won’t you
sit down?” and he waved his hand in the direction
of two chairs.</p>

<p>“I asked you to call,” he went on at once, coming
straight to the point, “because I wish to put one
or two questions to Miss Hagerston verbally. Will
you tell me, please,” he turned to Yootha, “how
long you have been engaged to be married to Captain
Preston?”</p>

<p>The girl started.</p>

<p>“Who told you we were engaged?” she exclaimed,
coloring. “Our engagement has not yet been announced
in the papers.”</p>

<p>“I am aware of that, but it is our business to
know things before they are made public. How
long, Miss Hagerston?”</p>

<p>“Ten days. But has this any bearing on the
theft of the pearl necklace?”</p>

<p>“Indirectly—&#8203;yes. And you made his acquaintance
at lunch at the Ritz on August the ninth of last
year, I think?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
“Since then you have met him frequently, I take
it?”</p>

<p>“No, only of late.”</p>

<p>“And for some time you have been friendly with
a young man named Harry Hopwood, a newspaper
correspondent?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t say ‘friendly.’ I have met him from
time to time.”</p>

<p>“Now, there is a well-known Society woman with
whom you and Mrs. Hartsilver are both acquainted—&#8203;Mrs.
Mervyn-Robertson. A little while ago you
may remember, you and Mrs. Hartsilver came here
to ask us to make private inquiries about Mrs.
Mervyn-Robertson’s past life. Since then Mr. Hopford
has called here on a similar mission, and Captain
Preston and a Mr. George Blenkiron have done
the same. We have found out certain things about
the lady which we have reported to you all separately;
other things we have found out which for
private reasons we deem it inadvisable to tell you,
at any rate for the moment. We should like to
warn you, however, that the lady referred to has
many influential friends, and we would venture to
advise you to attempt as little as possible to pry
into her private life. She is a dangerous woman,
a very dangerous woman, though this, naturally I
tell you in strictest confidence.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” Yootha answered. “And now can
you throw any light at all upon the mystery of the
stolen pearls?”</p>

<p>“I am coming to that. You no doubt heard some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>time ago of a robbery of jewelry and bank notes
from a safe in Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson’s own house
in Cavendish Square, though nothing about it appeared
in the papers?”</p>

<p>“Yes, everybody seemed to know about that at
the time.”</p>

<p>“Everything stolen that night was covered by a
special insurance. Now, the pearl necklace with
the theft of which you were unjustly charged was
also covered by a special insurance, and the policy
was made out by the Company which insured Mrs.
Mervyn-Robertson’s jewelry. Madame Marietta
Stringborg, to whom the stolen pearl necklace found
in your possession belonged, is a friend of Mrs.
Robertson—&#8203;they met first in Shanghai some years
ago. These may have been coincidences, of
course—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>As Yootha did not answer, Cora said:</p>

<p>“Do you mean to imply that there may have
been—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>“I imply nothing,” Stothert interrupted,
“but—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>He pressed twice an electric button on the table,
and almost at once a handsome young woman with
a Semitic caste of countenance entered. It was
Camille Lenoir.</p>

<p>“My partner,” Stothert said, by way of introduction.
“Camille,” he looked up at her from
where he sat, while she remained standing, “do
you remember what Lord Froissart said to you the
last time he came here—&#8203;it was the morning of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>day on which he took his life—&#8203;concerning recent
heavy insurances effected in respect to diamonds
with the insurance company of which he was a
director?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, “he said he believed that
some owners of valuable jewelry were insuring such
jewelry and then planning bogus robberies, that
is to say arranging for insured property to be ‘stolen’
by persons who eventually would return the property
to the insurer after the insurance money had been
paid.”</p>

<p>“Collusion, in short,” Cora said. “Mr. Stothert
says he implies nothing regarding Mrs. Robertson,
yet—&#8203;yes, I follow you both.”</p>

<p>“No, come here, please.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, Stothert unlocked and pulled open
a drawer in the roll-top desk at which he sat. From
it he took a small sealed packet, broke the seals,
unfolded it, and revealed a splendid pearl necklace.</p>

<p>“This is Madame Stringborg’s necklace,” he said.
“The necklace found in your possession, Miss Hagerston,
was made of imitation pearls.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Sixteen">XVI.</abbr>
</h3>
<h4>GATHERING CLOUDS.
</h4>
</div>

<p>Henley week is said to be fine once in eight years,
so presumably it was an eighth year, for the weather
was perfect.</p>

<p>Captain Preston, an old blue, had made a point
of attending the historic regatta ever since he had
been at school; then had come a gap, due to the
war, and then the regatta had been once more held.</p>

<p>To celebrate the event, also because he thought
Yootha would like it, Preston had this year rented
a houseboat which he kept moored near Maidenhead.
Several times before they were engaged Yootha
had spent a day with him on this boat, though he
had not even then made up his mind to propose to
her. But now the boat was moored at Henley,
for the regatta week, and he had asked a few of his
friends to come and lunch on board any day they
felt inclined to. It was his intention then to announce
his engagement, and to present them to his
future wife.</p>

<p>None of his friends, however, put in an appearance.
Some telegraphed their inability at the last moment
to get out of town; others stayed away without
sending an excuse.</p>

<p>Preston was surprised.</p>

<p>“Curious,” he said thoughtfully, as he shook the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>ashes out of his pipe about lunch time on the second
day of the regatta. “I thought some of them would
turn up to-day. Cooper and Atherton are down
here, I know, because I saw them in a punt together
half an hour ago.”</p>

<p>Yootha, lying back near him in a deck chair,
partly concealed by the overhead awning, did not
reply.</p>

<p>“You seem silent to-day, my darling,” he said
after a pause. “Is anything the matter?”</p>

<p>He bent down as he stopped speaking, and peered
under the awning.</p>

<p>The troubled look in her eyes disconcerted him.</p>

<p>“Darling, what is it?” he asked anxiously. “Is
something worrying you?”</p>

<p>“Not worrying me, exactly,” she answered, with
rather a wan smile, “only—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>“Yes? Only what?”</p>

<p>“I think I can guess why your friends have stayed
away. It isn’t hard to guess.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it? Well, I wish I knew the reason—&#8203;ah—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>His expression had suddenly changed.</p>

<p>“So now you know,” she went on. “Personally
I am not surprised. You know how people have
cold-shouldered me since that dreadful affair at the
ball. Now it has become known we are engaged,
people want less than ever to meet me. Had you
been here alone, your friends would probably all
have come to lunch.”</p>

<p>“‘Friends,’ you call them?” Preston exclaimed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>with a black look. “They are no longer friends of
mine, I can assure you, if they are that sort.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t blame them,” Yootha answered with
a hard smile. “One has to pay the penalty of
notoriety, even though the notoriety may have come
unsought. I dare say I shall live it down,” and she
gave a little shrug.</p>

<p>A tiny boat was sailing past, and the young man
seated in the stern of it hailed Preston.</p>

<p>“Can I come aboard a moment?” he called out.
“I want to speak to you.”</p>

<p>“Come along,” Preston answered, though without
enthusiasm, for the young man was Archie La
Planta. Half a minute later the little boat was
alongside.</p>

<p>“I hope I am not intruding,” La Planta said, discovering
suddenly, or pretending to discover, that
nobody else besides Yootha was aboard. “I heard
you had a luncheon party. By the way,” he added,
“have I to congratulate you? I heard the news
only to-day.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” Preston said, concealing the annoyance
the unlooked-for intrusion caused him. “Who
told you we were engaged?”</p>

<p>“Oh, one or two people. That last race was a
fine finish—&#8203;what?”</p>

<p>“Very. Did you say there was something you
wanted to ask me?”</p>

<p>“One or two things. The first is a message from
Jessica. She wants to know if you and Miss Hagerston
will come to tea on her houseboat—&#8203;it’s that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>big boat, <cite>The Apex</cite>, disguised to look like a warship,
with guns and all complete. They’ve a jolly
party aboard and Jessica says she would love to
see you both. I was instructed not on any account
to let you say ‘No,’” and he laughed.</p>

<p>Preston did not answer for a moment.</p>

<p>“What do you say, Yootha?” he said at last,
with a significant look which she understood. “Shall
we go, or shan’t we?”</p>

<p>“I should like to go,” she replied, taking her
cue from his expression. “Have you had lunch,
Mr. La Planta?”</p>

<p>“In point of fact I have not,” he said carelessly,
and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>“Then you had better stay and lunch,” Preston
put in. “Others may drop in presently.”</p>

<p>“Awfully good of you,” La Planta said quietly.
“The second thing I want to ask is whether you
happen to have seen Madame Camille Lenoir of the
Metropolitan Secret Agency anywhere about to-day.
I know she is here, with friends, and I want
particularly to catch her.”</p>

<p>“I have not noticed her in any of the boats.”</p>

<p>Archie La Planta made a little gesture of annoyance.</p>

<p>“How tiresome,” he said. “Several people have
caught sight of her to-day, but nobody can tell me
where she is to be found. By the way, has the
house with the bronze face found anything out as
yet about the pearl necklace?”</p>

<p>“Nothing as yet, but they seem hopeful. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>think that in a week or so they may be able to tell
me something.”</p>

<p>“Good. Stothert is not an optimist, and would
not have told you that unless he had good reason
to.”</p>

<p>He turned to Yootha.</p>

<p>“By the way, I have not seen you since the
ball,” he said. “And for that matter I didn’t see
you at the ball, because I couldn’t identify you.
That was a rotten experience you had—&#8203;perfectly
disgraceful to treat you as they did. I hear it
made you quite ill, and I am not surprised. I
hope that by now you have quite recovered?”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she answered, and in spite of her
effort to speak naturally she could not prevent a
certain coldness from betraying itself in her voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have recovered—&#8203;though I don’t think all
my friends have!”</p>

<p>“Indeed? I think I don’t follow you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s of no consequence,” she replied, flushing
slightly; then she changed the subject.</p>

<p>Jessica was surprisingly genial and friendly when
she greeted Yootha and Captain Preston on her
houseboat a couple of hours later. Preston had
availed himself of her invitation for a reason which
he had not yet confided to Yootha, though, had he
known it, the same reason had prompted Yootha
to ask La Planta if he had lunched.</p>

<p>They knew that in spite of the olive branch now
held out by Jessica, at heart Jessica’s dislike of
them both had become, if anything, intensified since
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>the affair at the ball, and that her hatred of Cora
too had increased. Though not addicted to crediting
gossip, so many little remarks of Jessica’s concerning
themselves had been repeated to them by
different people that they could not turn an entirely
deaf ear.</p>

<p>All sorts of well-known people were on Jessica’s
houseboat. Some Yootha had met, and to many
of the remainder she and Preston were introduced.
Indeed so friendly did everybody appear to be that
presently she began to feel quite happy and at
home—&#8203;the reverse of what she and Preston had
anticipated.</p>

<p>And of all aboard, none made himself more agreeable
to Yootha and to Captain Preston than Archie
La Planta. If anything, he rather overdid it, for
he took the trouble to present several people whom
they found extremely boring. They had been aboard
perhaps half an hour, when Yootha suddenly heard
her name spoken, and, turning, found herself face
to face with a dark, very intelligent-looking man
approaching middle age.</p>

<p>“Let me introduce Doctor Johnson,” Stapleton
said. “Johnson—&#8203;Miss Hagerston.”</p>

<p>The doctor looked at her keenly, smiling as he
raised his hat.</p>

<p>“Our common friend, Captain Preston, has several
times mentioned your name,” he said. “Is
he with you to-day?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” Yootha answered. “He was here a
minute ago. Have you only just come aboard?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
“No, I have been here the whole afternoon, but
for the last hour I have been what I suppose is
called ‘’tween decks,’ settling the nation’s affairs
with some of my cronies whom I don’t often have
an opportunity of meeting,” and he smiled. “Stapleton
tells me, Miss Hagerston, that you and Preston
are engaged. May I be allowed to offer my congratulations?
I should like to congratulate you
both very sincerely.”</p>

<p>Yootha colored as she looked over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much,” she said. “I feel as if
we had met before; Charlie has told me so much
about you.”</p>

<p>“Well, though I have known him quite a short
time, you will forgive my saying that I like him
immensely. Yet, but for the unfortunate affair of
that man’s death the other night, I suppose I should
not have had the pleasure of meeting him, or possibly
you. Ah, here he comes.”</p>

<p>For five minutes or more the three remained in
conversation, though their talk was mostly commonplace.
There were subjects all three would have
liked to broach, but to have done so amid that
<i lang="fr">entourage</i> would have been impolitic.</p>

<p>“Yootha and I are dining <i lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> on my houseboat,”
Preston said after a while. “If you are not
engaged, couldn’t you join us—&#8203;if you will take potluck?
Do say you will, Johnson.”</p>

<p>Johnson reflected for some moments.</p>

<p>“I should like to very much,” he said at last.
“It is most kind of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
“Capital! Then that is arranged.”</p>

<p>A diversion was created by the approach of a
motor-launch with a party of masked entertainers,
while the string quartette in the bows played a
popular air. As it came near it slowed down, then
stopped alongside.</p>

<p>“Oh, those people are splendid,” Jessica exclaimed.
“They were here yesterday and played for us during
lunch. Louie,” she turned to Stapleton, “make
them give us an entertainment now.”</p>

<p>The entertainment lasted a long time, so that
Preston and Yootha were unable to leave the houseboat,
as they had been about to do when the launch
came in sight. When at last the entertainment
ended they sought out their hostess.</p>

<p>“But surely you are not going?” Jessica exclaimed,
holding Yootha’s hand. “We are only just
beginning to enjoy ourselves! Can’t you both stay
to dinner? We want to drink your health, you
know,” and she laughed in her deep and musical
voice.</p>

<p>“So good of you,” Yootha answered, though all
the while her instinct told her that beneath this
show of friendship and hospitality there lurked
some sinister motive, “but we have a friend dining
with us on our boat.”</p>

<p>“Ah, in that case I suppose there is nothing
further to be said,” Jessica replied. “But I am
very disappointed. Come to lunch to-morrow, will
you? And you too, Captain Preston, make her
bring you with her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
But Preston excused himself on the plea that
he expected friends to lunch.</p>

<p>“Sometimes, though, friends don’t turn up,”
Jessica said inconsequently. “If they don’t, mind
you come, both of you.”</p>

<p>A few minutes after they had gone a man rowed
up rapidly in a dinghy.</p>

<p>“Can I speak to Captain Preston, please?” he
asked. “I am his servant. I have just come from
his house-boat.”</p>

<p>He had addressed La Planta, who, leaning against
the rail, had been watching him approach.</p>

<p>“Is it anything important?” La Planta inquired,
eyeing the man coldly.</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>“Well, Captain Preston and Miss Hagerston have
just left. You must have passed them.”</p>

<p>“Have they gone back to the boat?”</p>

<p>“I expect so. They went down stream.”</p>

<p>Borne along the water came the strains of a revue
waltz played further down the river by the string
quartette.</p>

<p>Preston’s servant pulled the dinghy round, then
started to row back.</p>

<p>And La Planta, blowing rings of cigarette smoke,
watched him, with a look of amusement, growing
smaller and smaller in the distance.</p>

<p>At last he straightened himself. Most of the
guests had now left. Barely a dozen remained.
Some one touched his elbow, and he turned.</p>

<p>“Well?” Stapleton said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
La Planta nodded.</p>

<p>“Quite satisfactory,” he answered.</p>

<p>“And when will he receive it?”</p>

<p>La Planta glanced down at his wrist-watch.</p>

<p>“He may have got it already. I am glad that
fellow missed him, though I can’t think how he managed
to. What fools people like Preston and that
girl of his and Cora Hartsilver and the rest of them
are to pit their wits against ours!”</p>

<p>“Preston is no fool, Archie. Nor, for that matter,
is Cora.”</p>

<p>But La Planta made no reply. Instead, he
shrugged his shoulders, then tossed his cigarette
into the water with a gesture of contempt.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Seventeen">XVII.</abbr>
</h3>
<h4>“NOBODY MUST KNOW!”
</h4>
</div>

<p>Preston’s servant, an ex-soldier who had served
under him in France, returned to the houseboat,
but neither Preston nor Yootha had arrived.</p>

<p>The man looked about him, puzzled. Then, concluding
that his master must have been detained
by friends on his way back, he began to attend to
his work.</p>

<p>But when an hour had passed, and still Preston
did not return, he went outside and scanned the
river with his master’s field-glasses. It was past
seven, and he had dinner nearly ready. It would be
annoying if his master stayed away for dinner without
giving him warning.</p>

<p>Presently a boat stopped alongside, and its sole
occupant got out and came aboard.</p>

<p>“Captain Preston about?” he inquired breezily.
“I am dining with him.”</p>

<p>“Dining with him, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Hasn’t he told you?”</p>

<p>“He has not been here since four o’clock, sir.
He and Miss Hagerston went out to tea and have
not been back since. I have an important letter
for him and wish he would return.”</p>

<p>It was now Johnson’s turn to look puzzled.</p>

<p>“I met him and Miss Hagerston at tea,” he said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>at last, “and they invited me to come and dine. I
can’t understand it. Anyhow, I had better wait.”</p>

<p>“If you would, sir. As he has invited you to
dine he is bound to be back soon.”</p>

<p>Johnson looked again at the man.</p>

<p>“Haven’t I seen you somewhere before?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, at Fig Tree Court.”</p>

<p>“Of course. I remember.”</p>

<p>He lay back in the deck-chair which he had
taken, lit a cigarette, and began carelessly to focus
the boats on the river through Preston’s binocular.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock the man came back.</p>

<p>“Hadn’t I better serve your dinner, sir?” he
inquired tentatively. “I am sure the captain would
not like you to be kept waiting. Something important
must have detained him, sir, for he is always
punctual to the moment, and of course there being
no telephone—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>“Thank you, but I will wait a little longer. If
he is not back by half-past eight perhaps I will have
something to eat, as I can’t get anything anywhere
else now.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” and the man retired with noiseless
tread.</p>

<p>But at half-past eight neither Preston nor Yootha
had returned, nor had they by half-past nine. Johnson
had waited until nine, then had eaten a light
meal and gone away.</p>

<p>The ex-soldier was becoming anxious.</p>

<p>He pulled out of his pocket the long envelope
addressed to his master, which had been brought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>by a man in flannels who had appeared to him a
gentleman and had assured him the letter was most
urgent and must be delivered at the earliest possible
moment.</p>

<p>“I wonder if this would throw some light on
it?” he said aloud, as he eyed the envelope suspiciously.
“So help me, I’d like to know.”</p>

<p>It was a gorgeous night, without a breath of air,
and as warm as in the tropics. As the man stood
on the deck of the house-boat smoking a cigar and
with his hands in his pockets, his thoughts traveled
back to the many hardships he and his master had
endured together in France during the three years
he had served under him; of the tight corners they
had more than once found themselves in; and of
his master’s extraordinary coolness in moments of
extreme crisis.</p>

<p>“Ah, if they was all like him,” he said reflectively,
“we should have an army, and no mistake!”</p>

<p>For, like many another British Tommy who had
been face to face with death alongside his officers,
the fellow worshiped Preston. In such high esteem
did he hold him, indeed, that sometimes his
friends would grow weary of hearing “Captain
Preston’s” many virtues extolled by the faithful
servant, and curtly bid him “shut up.”</p>

<p>It was nearly eleven when the man, half-dozing
in a deck-chair, heard his name called. Instantly
he sprang up.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir? That you, sir? Nothing the matter,
I hope, sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
In the moonlight Preston and Yootha Hagerston
could be seen standing together on the bank.</p>

<p>“Are you alone, Tom?” Preston asked. His voice
had a curious timbre.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Doctor Johnson came to dinner, sir,
but as you had not returned by nine o’clock I gave
him dinner alone, sir.”</p>

<p>“You did quite right.”</p>

<p>After speaking a few words under his breath to
Yootha, Preston came aboard alone, leaving her
standing on the bank.</p>

<p>“Tom,” he said in a low tone; “Miss Hagerston
is in rather an embarrassing position. Things have
happened which have prevented her returning to
town with Mrs. Hartsilver, who was to have met her
after leaving her friends, and there isn’t a bed to
be had anywhere, and of course the last train to
London has gone. There is nothing for it but for
Miss Hagerston to sleep here, but nobody must know
about it, you understand. Now, what can we arrange?”</p>

<p>Tom rubbed his chin. Then suddenly he looked
up.</p>

<p>“I can sleep on deck, sir, in a deck-chair; very
nice on a night like this. Then if you would sleep
in my quarters, Miss Hagerston could have your
quarters and be completely cut off, sir.”</p>

<p>Preston reflected.</p>

<p>“That seems the only solution,” he said at last.
“But, as I say—&#8203;nobody must know.”</p>

<p>“Nobody shall know, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
“Right.”</p>

<p>He turned, and called to Yootha to come aboard.
Then he told her of the arrangement.</p>

<p>She was pale, and looked greatly worried. There
were dark marks under her eyes, and a casual
acquaintance who had met her in the afternoon
would hardly have believed her now to be the same
woman. She was silent and <i lang="fr">distraite</i>.</p>

<p>“To-night’s adventure seems like a horrid nightmare,”
she exclaimed a little later, suddenly gripping
Preston’s arm. “What is it makes people so horrible,
Charlie? All to-day we were so happy, and
now—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly, and a sob choked her.
Preston put his arms about her, kissing her at first
gently, then passionately, on the lips.</p>

<p>“My little girl mustn’t fret,” he murmured. “I
know it is all dreadful, but it will pass. We think
now there is no way of escape, because we can see
none, but we shall find a way. My darling must
leave everything to me and place implicit confidence
in me.”</p>

<p>But though he spoke thus his heart was heavy.
And on the top of it all here was Yootha alone with
him in his house-boat for the night. True, nobody
need know, but the risk of discovery existed, and
so long as it existed there was danger, especially in
view of his and Yootha’s experience during the past
few hours. Blackmailers he had for years looked
upon with loathing, and always he had told himself
that should he by any extraordinary mishap ever
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>render himself open to blackmail he would then
and there face the music, attack his attacker, thrash
him if need be, do anything and everything sooner
than accede to any scoundrel’s proposals.</p>

<p>And yet here he was hemmed in with Yootha and
on the point of becoming an unwilling accessory
to another’s blackmail in order to shield, not himself
only—&#8203;that, he told himself, he never would have
done—&#8203;but the woman he loved to distraction, and
to protect her honor. The prospect was too awful,
and, as he thought about it now, racking his brain
to find a way out of the net which had been so
cleverly drawn around them both, every way seemed
blocked, and a cold perspiration broke out all over
him.</p>

<p>Silently he kissed Yootha once more as she bade
him good night, and for several minutes they remained
locked in each other’s arms.</p>

<p>When he was alone again, Tom came to him.
In his hand was a large, rather bulky gray envelope.</p>

<p>“This was brought for you, sir, about six o’clock,
and as it is marked very urgent I took the dinghy
and rowed to the boat where you had gone to tea,
but the gentleman told me you had just left.”</p>

<p>“What gentleman?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know his name, sir, but—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>And he described his appearance.</p>

<p>“La Planta,” Preston said aloud, with a frown.
Then he took the letter and went below to read it
by the light of the lamp, leaving Tom on deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
About two minutes later the ex-soldier stopped
abruptly in his work of folding up the deck-chairs,
and listened. No sound was audible.</p>

<p>“Strange,” he murmured. “I could have sworn
I heard a groan.”</p>

<p>Stepping very quietly, he crept down the few
steps, then peered into his master’s cabin, the door
of which stood half open.</p>

<p>Preston, seated with his elbows on the table, his
head resting between his hands, was staring at some
letters spread out in front of him. Thus he remained
for several moments, motionless, though
from where Tom stood his heavy breathing was
audible.</p>

<p>Tom gave a light knock on the door, then entered.</p>

<p>Preston gave no sign.</p>

<p>“Is there anything more I can do for you, sir,
before I go to bed?” the man asked.</p>

<p>Preston did not reply. He still made no sign,
and seemed unconscious of the other’s presence.</p>

<p>Tom was about to repeat the inquiry, when all
at once Preston collapsed in a heap, his head falling
forward heavily on to the table.</p>

<p>Instantly his servant sprang to his assistance.
Thinking he must have fainted, though never before
had he known him to faint, the man loosened his
collar, then ran quickly away and returned with
water with which he began to bathe his master’s
temples and the back of his neck. Thus he continued
for some minutes, at the end of which time
Preston began slowly to recover consciousness. Soon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>he looked into Tom’s face, then gripped his hand
tightly.</p>

<p>“Tom,” he exclaimed in a hoarse whisper. “I
have had bad news, very bad news. I may be in
great difficulties soon, and you are about the only
man who will then be able to help me. I can trust
you implicitly, eh, Tom?”</p>

<p>He gave the man a searching look, with an expression
in his eyes which Tom had never seen
there before. Though only his servant, Tom had
come to be looked upon by Preston, who had so
often faced death with him, as a personal friend.</p>

<p>“I think so, sir,” he answered grimly. “Do you
feel a little better now, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m all right. Tell me who handed you
the letter you gave me just now?”</p>

<p>Tom described the appearance of the man in
flannels.</p>

<p>“Did he say anything?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Only asked me to be sure to give it
to you the moment you returned, as it was very
urgent. I was to give it to you myself, sir.”</p>

<p>He turned, opened a little cupboard in the corner,
and took out a tantalus and a siphon.</p>

<p>“You had better drink this, sir,” and he handed
his master a stiff brandy and soda.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Tom.”</p>

<p>When he had emptied the tumbler, Preston looked
better.</p>

<p>“Miss Hagerston must know nothing about my
being taken ill,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
“She shall not, sir.”</p>

<p>“Or that I received a letter brought by hand.”</p>

<p>“She shall not, sir.”</p>

<p>“Tom, is my little automatic anywhere about?”</p>

<p>The man glanced at him suspiciously. A thought
had flashed into his mind, but the next moment he
had dismissed it, and replied:</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I have it.”</p>

<p>“Keep it loaded, will you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And now you can go to bed, Tom. I hope you
will manage to sleep on that chair.”</p>

<p>“We have both of us slept in worse places than
that, sir,” and he smiled grimly at the recollection.
“Will you be all right now, sir?”</p>

<p>“Quite all right. I think the heat upset me.
Good night, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Good night, sir.”</p>

<p>“The heat!” Tom murmured as he rolled himself
up in his blanket in the deck-chair. “I <em>don’t</em> think!”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Eighteen">XVIII.</abbr>
</h3>
<h4>WHAT DOCTOR JOHNSON KNEW.
</h4>
</div>

<p>There had been several rather startling suicides
during the season which was now ending, of men
and women of social standing, and in every case the
usual verdict had been returned. The events had
created a certain amount of interest; theories to
account for the tragedies had been advanced; then
the nine days’ wonder had subsided and London life
had gone on again as usual.</p>

<p>When, however, no less than seven men and five
women of high rank and apparently without a care
in the world had ended their lives within the first
three weeks of July, the newspapers had begun to
agitate to know the reason of this epidemic of
suicides which exceeded even the epidemic of 1918,
when Lord Hope-Cooper, Viscount Molesley, the
Honorable Vera Froissart, Madame Leonora Vandervelt,
Sir Stephen Lethbridge, Henry Hartsilver, and
others, had died by their own hand.</p>

<p>In Society, too, everybody had begun to talk.
The mystery of Lord Froissart’s suicide comparatively
recently, when his body had been found
at the foot of the cliffs at Bournemouth, had never
been solved. Now the hot weather was held by
some to be responsible for the series of tragedies,
but this theory was not general. Interviewed on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>the subject of the “epidemic” several eminent psychologists
and scientists expounded their views in
more or less complex language, the meaning of
which most people failed to grasp.</p>

<p>Indeed, the majority of those interviewed endeavored
to convince the public that the series
of tragedies was due to whatever cause they themselves
happened to be interested in. Thus the
spiritualists had theories concerning “souls” and
“vampires” and the vengeance of people long dead;
ecclesiastics were perfectly certain the prevalence
of suicide was due to men’s, and especially to
women’s, sinful way of living; followers of certain
unconventional physicians’ views on eugenics attributed
the outbreak to the effects of “unwholesome
environment,” though in what way the dead
people’s environment had been unwholesome they
did not explain; while advocates of early Victorianism
were ready to “prove” that the tragedies would
have been unthinkable in their young days.</p>

<p>All such speculation of course led nowhere, and
served only to increase anxiety as well as alarm.
The theory which enlisted most adherents was that
folk lavishly endowed with this world’s goods were
in the habit of exercising so little self-control that
eventually their minds became affected, and finally
unbalanced. This was, to some extent, the view
held by Doctor Johnson, and he told Blenkiron as
much when, happening to meet him one day at
his club, their conversation drifted to the prevalent
topic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
“I am anxious about our common friend, Charlie
Preston,” Blenkiron said presently. “Have you
seen him lately?”</p>

<p>“Not since Henley week,” Johnson replied. “What
is the matter with him?”</p>

<p>“I am certain he has something on his mind;
he appears to me to have changed enormously
within the last week or so.”</p>

<p>“In what way?”</p>

<p>“All the ‘vim’ seems to have gone out of him.
He seems to be always preoccupied, always thinking—&#8203;thinking.
Often when I speak to him he doesn’t
answer; in fact I don’t believe he hears. He used
not to be like that.”</p>

<p>“He is engaged to be married.”</p>

<p>“I know, but I am positive that isn’t the reason.
If it is, heaven prevent my ever becoming engaged!”
and Blenkiron smiled rather grimly.</p>

<p>“Then to what do you attribute it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t attribute it. There is nothing to which
I can attribute it. But I tell you this in confidence,
Johnson—&#8203;if I heard that Charlie Preston had become
another victim to the suicide epidemic I should
not be surprised.”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so! He is one of the last men
I should have thought capable of that. When could
I see him, I wonder? I should like to have a talk
with him, after what you say.”</p>

<p>“Why not ask him to lunch one day? Oddly
enough, Johnson, Miss Hagerston, whom he is to
marry, has greatly changed too. This is not imagination
on my part, I can assure you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
But before Johnson could invite Preston to lunch,
something happened.</p>

<p>This was a visit which Johnson received from
Cora Hartsilver; she had become acquainted with
him about the time when Yootha was in trouble
regarding the pearl necklace.</p>

<p>Cora had made an appointment by telephone, and
during the afternoon she called.</p>

<p>“I have come to see you,” she said, “about my
friend, Miss Hagerston, who tells me she had the
pleasure of meeting you at Henley.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and I had the pleasure of congratulating
her upon her engagement. She is not indisposed, I
hope?”</p>

<p>“Indeed she is, seriously indisposed, though not
in the way you mean. She is mentally indisposed,
if I may put it so.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear that. Can you give me a
few particulars?”</p>

<p>“Well, she is staying with me at present, and
has been since Henley week. She asked me if she
might come to stay with me because she could no
longer sleep at night in her flat—&#8203;she got frightened
and had terrible nightmares, she said. That she has
something on her mind I am absolutely convinced;
yet though we are such intimate friends she positively
refuses to tell me anything, though she as
good as admits that she is worried. So I thought
I would take the liberty of asking your advice
without telling her.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t I better see her?”</p>

<p>“I think not, at least not yet. Your calling to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>see her would arouse her suspicion, because I have
asked her once or twice to let me ask a doctor to
call, and each time she has strongly opposed the
suggestion.”</p>

<p>“Is she unhappy at the thought of her approaching
marriage?”</p>

<p>“Indeed no! She is terribly in love. In fact,
I tremble to think what would happen to her if any
mishap befell Captain Preston. So strongly do I
feel on that point that sometimes I wonder if she
has some secret cause to believe that some mishap
may befall him. He seems greatly worried too.”</p>

<p>“So I understand.”</p>

<p>“Why, who told you?”</p>

<p>“His great friend, Blenkiron.”</p>

<p>“Well, Doctor Johnson, what do you suggest?”</p>

<p>For a minute the doctor did not answer.</p>

<p>“You say the change in Miss Hagerston dates
from Henley Regatta?” he said at last.</p>

<p>“From the morning of the third day. She went
to the Regatta on the second day only. She went
with Captain Preston.”</p>

<p>“That was the day I met them both on Mrs.
Mervyn-Robertson’s house-boat. They were then
both in the best of spirits, apparently, and looked
radiantly happy.”</p>

<p>Again he pondered, his brow slightly contracted.</p>

<p>“Where did Miss Hagerston sleep that night?”
he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>This was a question Cora had not expected. She
colored violently. Then she said awkwardly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
“Oh, at her flat in Knightsbridge, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know for certain?”</p>

<p>“No. How should I?”</p>

<p>“You say that you and Miss Hagerston are great
friends, Mrs. Hartsilver, so I thought that probably
you would know. She did not, I suppose, spend
the night on Preston’s house-boat?”</p>

<p>“How could she, Doctor Johnson, alone with
him!”</p>

<p>The doctor looked at her keenly, but she would
not meet his gaze.</p>

<p>“Why not be frank with me, Mrs. Hartsilver,”
he said, lowering his voice. “She did spend the
night on the boat with him, and you know it.”</p>

<p>Cora looked terribly alarmed.</p>

<p>“Oh, for heaven’s sake, doctor,” she exclaimed,
“don’t let anybody know! Think what would be
said, the inference that would be drawn, especially
as they are engaged. I will be frank with you,
then. I was with friends at Henley, and Yootha
was to have met me at ten o’clock at night, and
we were to have returned to town together. But
she did not meet me, and I, thinking she must
have gone back to London alone, returned with
my friends. As soon as I got home I rang up her
flat, and her maid said she had not come in; the
maid was sitting up, awaiting her. I was dreadfully
upset, and blamed myself for having missed her.</p>

<p>“Next morning, about noon, she came to my
house, looking very ill and worried. She said that
she and Captain Preston had forgotten all about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>the time until it was too late to meet me, also by
then the last train had gone. Captain Preston
tried everywhere to find a bed for her, but there
was not one to be had. Finally there was nothing
for it but for her to return with the captain to his
house-boat, where he gave her his bed and slept
himself in his servant’s bed, while his servant slept
outside in a deck-chair. That is what she told me,
and I believe every word, because she couldn’t lie
to me. There was no harm in it at all, believe me,
there was not, but of course it would not do for
people to know. Nobody knows but you and Captain
Preston’s servant, a man absolutely to be trusted
not to talk.”</p>

<p>“And Miss Hagerston’s maid. At least she knows
that her mistress did not come home.”</p>

<p>Johnson began to pace the room.</p>

<p>“Of course I shall treat what you have just told
me as strictly confidential,” he said, “but the fact
remains that we don’t know what happened during
the time Preston and Miss Hagerston left Mrs.
Mervyn-Robertson’s house-boat, and the time, late
at night, when they returned to his own house-boat.”</p>

<p>“What do you imply?” Cora asked sharply, drawing
herself up.</p>

<p>“Forgive me if I have conveyed a wrong impression,”
Johnson said, stopping in his walk. “I
assure you I did not mean to imply what you think.
Nothing was further from my mind. No, my
thoughts were traveling in quite a different channel.
Tell me, Mrs. Hartsilver, are Miss Hagerston and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>Captain Preston now on terms of intimacy with Mrs.
Mervyn-Robertson? They appeared to be the other
day, and I was surprised, because I was under the
impression that their acquaintanceship with her had
for some time past been, how shall I put it—&#8203;rather
strained?”</p>

<p>“Indeed it was more than rather strained,” Cora
answered quickly. “Mrs. Robertson detests Yootha
almost as much as she detests me, and I think I am
safe in saying that she bears Captain Preston no
love at all. As we are speaking in confidence I
may as well tell you that Miss Hagerston, Captain
Preston, myself, and one or two others have for
some months past suspected Jessica Mervyn-Robertson
and her friends, Mr. Aloysius Stapleton and
Mr. Archie La Planta, of being impostors of some
sort, if nothing worse; we have reasons for suspecting
this. Consequently we have been making
private inquiries about them of the Metropolitan
Secret Agency and other sources, and this, I think,
they have got to know. Captain Preston and Yootha
accepted their invitation to tea on their house-boat
chiefly out of curiosity, I believe, and were greatly
surprised at the exceptionally friendly reception
accorded them. I think they made a mistake in
associating with Mrs. Robertson at all in the circumstances.”</p>

<p>Johnson smiled.</p>

<p>“As that is so, Mrs. Hartsilver, perhaps you
will admit me to your little group which suspects
‘Mrs. Jessica’ and her two satellites of not being all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>that they seem to be. Tell me, wasn’t Captain
Preston in Shanghai at one time?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have heard him say so.”</p>

<p>“Well, from the middle of 1910 to the end of
1912 I practiced in Hong Kong. Englishmen, as
I dare say you know, become very clannish when
exiled in places of that sort. I used to visit Shanghai
rather frequently, where I had a <i lang="la">locum tenens</i>, and
if Mrs. Jessica and a notorious young woman named
Angela Robertson are not the same—&#8203;oh, but they
are the same, I am perfectly positive they are.
Stapleton, too, lived in Shanghai for a while—&#8203;that
must have been in 1911. He made the Astor Hotel
his home, remember, and though I only saw him
once or twice, and never met him to speak to, my
<i lang="la">locum tenens</i> had all sorts of extraordinary stories
about him, and my <i lang="la">locum</i> was not a man to heed
idle gossip.”</p>

<p>“Stapleton and Fobart Robertson—&#8203;the adventurer
whom Mrs. Jessica married—&#8203;were hand in
glove at that time. Then one day Fobart Robertson
found Shanghai too hot to hold him—&#8203;and if you had
ever been in Shanghai, Mrs. Hartsilver, you would
know how hot that must have been—&#8203;and left hurriedly,
whereupon Stapleton calmly stepped into his
shoes and became to all intents Mr. Robertson—&#8203;at
the club they nicknamed him ‘Fobart’s understudy.’
It created something of a scandal amongst the
British population, but in the East the morals of
most Europeans are on a lower plane than over here,
and after a while the <i lang="fr">liaison</i> came to be winked at,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>so that Angela Robertson was once more received
as she had been when living with her husband, and
Stapleton, being well-to-do and extremely hospitable,
and consequently popular, was no longer cold-shouldered.
Other friends of Angela Robertson’s
in Shanghai were, I remember, Mrs. Stringborg—&#8203;yes,
the woman whose necklace was removed—&#8203;and
a queer fellow called Timothy Macmahon. It was
Macmahon’s widow to whom Lord Froissart left all
his property, if you remember. Does all this interest
you, Mrs. Hartsilver, or am I boring you?”</p>

<p>“Boring me!” Cora exclaimed. “I am thrilled!
Captain Preston knows nothing of all this, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Not so far as I am aware. Of course it would
not do for me to say outside what I have just told
you in confidence. Having no evidence in support
of my statements I might get myself into serious
trouble, to say nothing of ruining my practice.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you will tell Captain Preston?”</p>

<p>“I would sooner you told him, Mrs. Hartsilver.”</p>

<p>Cora smiled.</p>

<p>“So that if either of us should get into trouble it
would not be you?”</p>

<p>“Precisely,” Johnson replied with a laugh. He
was silent for some moments.</p>

<p>“And now you may think what I am about to
say is strange, Mrs. Hartsilver, but I have rather
keen intuition, and something seems to tell me that
whatever happened to Preston and Miss Hagerston
that evening at Henley, which apparently upset
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>them, Angela Robertson and Stapleton had a hand
in it. The idea may sound ridiculous, but that is
my strong impression.”</p>

<p>“But what can have happened to them, doctor?”</p>

<p>“I have no idea—&#8203;at present. Can’t you induce
Miss Hagerston to tell you? You and she are such
friends.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid not, but I will try.”</p>

<p>“Supposing, for instance, that in the ardor of their
love for each other they should have been discovered
in some apparently compromising, though in reality
quite harmless situation—&#8203;and been blackmailed.
Such things happen oftener than you might suppose;
not that I suppose you ever think about such things.”</p>

<p>Cora glanced at him with an expression of horror.</p>

<p>“Is that really so?” she asked.</p>

<p>Johnson nodded.</p>

<p>“Almost any man or woman, not excepting the
most virtuous, may under certain circumstances get
let in for blackmail, and the wonder to me is that
more are not blackmailed. Look at this so-called
‘epidemic’ of suicide that everybody is talking about
and that the papers are full of. My private opinion
is that some, at any rate, are victims of blackmail,
who have taken their lives to escape public exposure.”</p>

<p>“But blackmailed by whom?”</p>

<p>“Ah, there you have me. The whole thing reads
to me as though the victims, if blackmailed, were
charged by the same person, or it may have been
by members of some gang, or an organization of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>some sort. Don’t you remember the series of suicides
which took place a year ago and that—&#8203;oh, I beg
your pardon, Mrs. Hartsilver. I had quite forgotten.”</p>

<p>“Pray don’t apologize, Doctor Johnson. I am
most interested in what you say. I wonder—&#8203;I wonder
if poor Henry—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>“I knew your husband slightly, Mrs. Hartsilver,
and I must say I was amazed when I read of the
tragedy. The last man—&#8203;the very last man—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>“So everybody said. Blackmail! Now I wonder
if—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>Unconsciously she stopped, for strange thoughts,
reflections, memories of little incidents, were crowding
in upon her. Then quickly her train of thought
shot away into a different channel. The man she
had loved so dearly, young Sir Stephen Lethbridge—&#8203;the
whole of the terrible affair came back to her,
as though it had happened the day before.</p>

<p>“Exactly the way Molesley made away with himself,”
again she heard her husband’s voice, unemotional,
cold as ice. And in Viscount Molesley’s room
a quantity of burnt papers, she remembered reading,
had been found in the grate and scattered beside
the body.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Nineteen">XIX.</abbr>
</h3>
<h4>WITHOUT A STAIN.
</h4>
</div>

<p>Alix Stothert, the mysterious manager of the
Metropolitan Secret Agency, lived in the house with
the bronze face, on the top floor, and so did his
partner, the woman known as Madame Camille
Lenoir.</p>

<p>They were a sinister couple, of whom nobody
seemed to know anything, and the police, when
questioned concerning them, as they had been on
more than one occasion, refused to make any statement.
That the police looked upon them with no
favorable eye was generally admitted by those in a
position to know, and the inference naturally drawn
was that Scotland Yard was jealous of the Metropolitan
Secret Agency’s extraordinary success in
making discoveries which led to the arrest of criminals
while the police failed to obtain even clues.</p>

<p>They lived a strange life, apparently, for the door
leading into the suite of rooms which they occupied
was always kept locked—&#8203;it had two Yale locks—&#8203;and
no servants or other helpers were ever admitted.</p>

<p>The sitting-room, “living-room” would have been
a better name for it, had three telephones, and a
metaphone which connected with their office on the
first floor. It had also a tape-machine, and in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>Stothert’s bedroom was a speaking tube which went
down to the back entrance of the house and was so
arranged that Stothert could be spoken to from a
blind alley off the narrow little street. On to this
blind alley the door opened.</p>

<p>Stothert and Camille Lenoir were alone in their
living room about ten o’clock one night during the
first week of August, when the speaking tube
whistled shrilly in the room adjoining. At once the
man got up and went into the bedroom to find out
who wanted him. For only a few seconds he listened.
Then he spoke one word, pushed the whistle
in again, and rejoined his partner.</p>

<p>“They are hot on the trail of Jessica,” he said
calmly, as he seated himself again, and readjusted
the eye-shade which he had taken off when he went
into the next room. “I believe in the end they will
prove her undoing, and Stapleton’s.”</p>

<p>“Shall you warn her?” the woman asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Certainly not. It is no concern of ours.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean—&#8203;no concern of ours?”</p>

<p>“In the circumstances. Had she treated us differently—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>“I understand. And whom has she mostly to
fear?”</p>

<p>“Preston. He is so clever, and has such foresight
and imagination, that Stapleton and La Planta
may find themselves presently on the horns of a
dilemma of their own creating.”</p>

<p>After a minute’s pause, during which he seemed
to be thinking deeply, he unhooked the receiver
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>from the transmitter on the table at his elbow, and
waited with it pressed to his ear, without asking
for any number.</p>

<p>“Please come here at once,” he said suddenly,
speaking into the transmitter.</p>

<p>“Yes, most important.”</p>

<p>“Yes, without any delay.”</p>

<p>Then he replaced the receiver, relit his pipe, which
had gone out, picked up a newspaper and began
carelessly to scan its headlines.</p>

<p>“I see Preston’s wedding is to take place shortly,”
he said presently.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” his companion observed significantly.</p>

<p>“Hulloa!” Stothert exclaimed suddenly, “have you
seen this, Camille? Levi Schomberg’s body is to
be exhumed.”</p>

<p>The woman sprang up from her chair, and leant
over Stothert’s shoulder to read the startling announcement.
It was contained in two lines in the
stop press. No reason for the exhumation was
given or hinted at.</p>

<p>“Alix, that will discomfort our friend,” she said
with a grin. “And Jessica and Stapleton too. I
wonder who brought that about.”</p>

<p>“That Doctor Johnson, you may depend. He
was much upset, as I told you, at his opinion at the
inquest being turned down by the coroner. This
may have an interesting sequel, not calculated to
set Jessica’s mind at rest.”</p>

<p>“And may strengthen Preston’s hand. I believe
that, all along, he and Blenkiron have suspected
La Planta.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
They went on talking about the exhumation and
what it might eventually lead to, until the whistle
of the speaking tube interrupted them once more.
After answering it Stothert pressed a button in the
wall, and waited. A minute later the door of the
room opened and a woman entered.</p>

<p>Young and very pretty, she was dressed apparently
for a ball or a reception. She shut the door
after her, then without ceremony went over and sat
down in a big arm-chair near the two occupants of
the room, neither of whom had risen or greeted her
when she entered.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” she asked curtly, addressing
Stothert.</p>

<p>“We want you to find out as soon as possible,
to-night if you can, where Mrs. Timothy Macmahon
is now, the woman to whom Lord Froissart left his
fortune which should have been inherited by his
elder daughter, Mrs. Ferdinand Westrup. When
last we heard of Mrs. Macmahon she still resided
in Cashel, County Tipperary. Where are you going
to-night?”</p>

<p>“To a reception in Berkeley Square,” and she
mentioned the name of her hostess. “You have put
me to great inconvenience by making me come here
at this hour.”</p>

<p>Stothert shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“We are all put to inconvenience at times,” he
said. “You surely did not expect me to make an
exception in your case? People of higher social
standing than you have been put to inconvenience
on our account.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
“Shall I ring you up if I discover the woman’s
whereabouts?” his visitor inquired, changing the
subject.</p>

<p>“If you please. Also you will notice if any people
of interest to us attend the reception. And take
this.” He handed her a sealed envelope. “Its contents
you can read when you have left here.”</p>

<p>For fully five minutes after the pretty visitor had
gone, Stothert sat in silence, sucking thoughtfully at
his pipe. His companion, apparently still thinking
about the announcement in the newspaper, made no
attempt to interrupt him. Suddenly he turned to
her and removed his pipe from his mouth.</p>

<p>“Froissart’s death was most unfortunate,” he said,
“most unfortunate. I particularly wanted him to
attend the Albert Hall ball, and he was going to on
our advice, if you remember.”</p>

<p>“Not more unfortunate than Sir Stephen Lethbridge’s
death,” Camille Lenoir answered, “or, for
that matter, Leonora Vandervelt’s. We have to
face these setbacks. Still, nobody up to the present
suspects our methods.”</p>

<p>“Up to the present—&#8203;no. But don’t be too confident.
The police would ask nothing better than
to be able to find out all about us, and how we
work, and then let us down in order to get back
on us. If the true verdict had been brought in
regarding Vera Froissart’s death, and the cause of
her suicide, it would have been a bad day for us.
I shall not be sorry when we cut adrift from this
business. There are times when the excitement of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>carrying on becomes too tense for a man of my
age.”</p>

<p>His companion smiled.</p>

<p>“How you keep on about your age,” she said.
“You may be getting on physically, but how many
men of your age possess your clear brain and your
clear intelligence? I don’t look forward to the
Schomberg inquiry, I can assure you. What can
they suspect? And who can have applied for the
exhumation? Not his relatives, I am sure. They
were too anxious to inherit his estate to be likely
to want inquiries to be made. And I am not of
your opinion that Johnson and Blenkiron made the
application.”</p>

<p>Nobody, listening to Camille then, would have
believed her to be the common French woman familiar
to clients of the Metropolitan Secret Agency.
For now, closeted with her partner in their private
sitting-room, she spoke excellent English, while her
foreign accent was barely perceptible.</p>

<p>The telephone bell rang, and Camille answered
it. Then she pressed her palm on the transmitter.</p>

<p>“Preston,” she said laconically. “He wants to
speak to you at once.”</p>

<p>Stothert took the instrument.</p>

<p>“That you, Captain Preston?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t see you to-night.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Almost any time to-morrow would suit
me.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry. I have no further news as yet, but
I hope to have some soon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
“Oh, yes, we are getting on famously, and on the
right line, I feel sure. By the way, I take it the
announcement of your approaching marriage in to-day’s
papers is official?”</p>

<p>“It is. Then I congratulate you. Good night,
Captain Preston.”</p>

<p>“He has not read the announcement about the
exhumation, apparently, and it was no affair of mine
to tell him,” Stothert remarked, when he had rung
off. “We must tell him something soon about Jessica,
if only to keep him quiet. By the way, Stapleton
told me recently that Levi Schomberg had hinted
to him more than once that Mrs. Hartsilver was
a designing woman. What can Schomberg’s reason
have been for saying what we know to be manifestly
untrue?”</p>

<p>“Probably the same reason which prompted him
to make other false statements,” Camille replied.
“We may learn that, and other curious things concerning
Levi at the inquiry.”</p>

<p>The news that apparently some mystery surrounded
Levi Schomberg’s death aroused considerable
comment. Though rarely seen in public places,
he had been well known to a comparatively large
circle of London Society, and had borne, rightly or
wrongly, the reputation of being the most “accommodating”
man of his calling in London.</p>

<p>This reputation had been due possibly to the fact
that his knowledge of the class for which he catered
had been exceedingly deep, also that he happened
to be an excellent judge of character and of human
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>nature. Thus where he would politely refuse to
accommodate A, B and C, with a loan, no matter
how small, to D, E and F, though in no better circumstances
and with no better security to offer, he
would readily advance quite large sums, instinctively
knowing them to be people who would eventually
repay the loans of their own accord, also the
heavy interest which he charged, even though before
doing so they might need to renew their bills perhaps
several times.</p>

<p>“Odd thing, this exhumation of Schomberg’s
body,” Blenkiron remarked carelessly as he stood
chatting with La Planta at the corner of Brook
Street one morning. “What do you make of it,
Archie?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me,” La Planta replied quickly. “I
only hope I shall not be dragged in to give evidence.
I begin to wish to heaven I had not met
Schomberg that night, but Louie would invite
him.”</p>

<p>“I wish you had been present at the inquest,”
Blenkiron went on. “Your documentary evidence
left several points undecided, as the coroner clearly
explained. I believe if those points had been cleared
up this exhumation business would never have come
about.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I now wish, too, that I had been there,
though I congratulated myself at the time on being
out of it all. The doctor, you see, wouldn’t let me
out of bed—&#8203;I had such a bad chill. What is your
theory concerning the cause of death?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
“Oh, I have no theory,” Blenkiron answered.
“The coroner attributed death to natural causes, so
I stand by his decision.”</p>

<p>“That is exactly my argument,” La Planta said
hurriedly. “Yet I meet fellows who declare they
thought all along there was something ‘fishy,’ as
they call it, about the poor fellow’s death, though
you may depend on it the ‘fishiness’ would never
have occurred to them if this exhumation had not
been ordered. The police, I hear, were notified
privately that there were certain doubts as to the
cause of death.”</p>

<p>Yet when the inquiry did take place, the report
was not wholly satisfactory. Though no traces of
any sort of poison could be found, the condition of
the remains was declared to be abnormal.</p>

<p>There is no need to go into details. The next
startling announcement was that Archie La Planta
had been arrested.</p>

<p>At once the newspapers focused the attention of
the public on the unhappy young man, and then
for the first time the searchlight of notoriety illuminated
as much of his past life as the press was able
to rake up. Indeed, it came as rather a shock to
some of his friends to find that apparently nothing
was known about him prior to his arrival in London
some years previously.</p>

<p>Questioned on this point during his cross-examination,
La Planta admitted having spent some years
of his life in the East, also that he had known Stapleton
in China. The question put as a trap: “Did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>you ever borrow money from deceased?” he emphatically
negatived.</p>

<p>“Now can you,” asked the cross-examiner a little
later, “account for the fact that some drops of a
very rare perfume, the name and nature of which
I need not for the moment specify, were found on
the left sleeve of the fancy tunic you wore at the
Albert Hall ball, and that some of the same perfume
was discovered on the fancy dress suit worn
by deceased that night?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” La Planta answered without an instant’s
hesitation. “I had a little phial of the perfume
with me at the ball, and as Mr. Schomberg
told me he liked the scent very much I gave him
a little. In fact I sprayed it on his clothes myself.”</p>

<p>“And where did you obtain the perfume? I understand
it is not to be had in London.”</p>

<p>“Quite true. I have to get it from abroad.”</p>

<p>“‘Abroad,’ is a big place, Mr. La Planta,” the
examining counsel observed dryly. “May I ask you
to be more definite in your statement? Perhaps
you will tell me from what town or place ‘abroad’
it is, or was, sent to you?”</p>

<p>“Shanghai.”</p>

<p>“Shanghai! Indeed! This is most interesting.
And who sends it to you from Shanghai? May I
have his—&#8203;or her—&#8203;name and address?”</p>

<p>At once La Planta scribbled on a scrap of paper
which he then handed to counsel for the prosecution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
When the latter had conferred in undertones with
his solicitor, he continued:</p>

<p>“Are you aware, Mr. La Planta, that this perfume
may not be legally sold or bought in this country
without a special license, also that to import it is
illegal, owing to its being, in addition to a perfume,
an extremely potent drug possessing peculiar properties?”</p>

<p>“I am aware of that.”</p>

<p>“And yet you deliberately imported it?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>To all present in Court it was obvious examining
counsel was becoming annoyed at La Planta’s frank
and unhesitating replies to questions meant to disconcert
him. For nearly two hours the examination
continued, and when at last it ended the witness
left the Court “without a stain upon his character”
so far as the Jew’s death was concerned.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Twenty">XX.</abbr>
</h3>
<h4>CONCERNS A RUMOR.
</h4>
</div>

<p>Preston had impatiently awaited the result of La
Planta’s cross-examination, and the verdict disappointed
him. For secretly he felt convinced still
that even if the young man had not directly connived
at the money-lender’s death, yet that he could
throw light on the cause of death if he wished to.</p>

<p>“I cannot help thinking,” he said to Yootha while
they were discussing the mystery on the day after
La Planta’s acquittal, “that he knows something too
concerning what happened at Henley regatta. I
have felt that all along. And had he been found
guilty of conniving at Schomberg’s death we might
have been in a position to escape from what now
threatens us. However, I believe that in the end
we shall be able to snap our fingers at the people
who are trying to blackmail us, so you must try
to cheer up, my darling.”</p>

<p>They were sitting out on the heather under the
shadow of the Sugarloaf Mountain in Monmouthshire,
where they had been staying for a fortnight
at the Angel Hotel in Abergavenny, and, but for
the development which threatened they would have
been completely happy. As it was, when they succeeded
in forgetting what the future might hold for
them, the hours were the happiest they had ever
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>spent. It was now August, but Monmouthshire is
one of the few counties which holiday makers seem
consistently to overlook in spite of its lovely scenery,
with the result that the picturesque moors were
almost deserted.</p>

<p>For some minutes they remained silent. The
quietude of the countryside, the almost oppressive
heat, the wonderful landscape which unfolded itself
before them, stretching away to the silvery river
Usk visible some miles down the valley, seemed in
harmony with their mood. And then presently,
gently placing his arm about her, Preston drew
Yootha closer to him and pressed his lips to hers.</p>

<p>“My darling,” he murmured, “whatever happens,
believe me I shall love you always—&#8203;always. Doesn’t
it seem strange that for all these years we should
not have met, and that then we should have become
acquainted by the merest chance? Supposing I had
not happened to wander into Bond Street that morning,
just a year ago—&#8203;it was the ninth of August,
the date of the opening of our great offensive on the
Western front—&#8203;and that I had not been with George,
who knew La Planta, and that La Planta had not
invited us to lunch with him at the Ritz we should
probably be strangers still! I believe I fell in love
with you that day, Yootha; certainly you attracted
me in the most extraordinary way directly we
were introduced—&#8203;you and your delightful friend,
Cora.”</p>

<p>“And yet during the whole lunch you spoke hardly
a word, and Jessica thought you dull and stupid,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>I remember,” she exclaimed, laughing. “I know,
because I heard her say so to Aloysius Stapleton.”</p>

<p>“I dare say I was dull and stupid. I certainly
felt dull, but several months of hospital life are
not calculated to sharpen one’s intelligence, are
they? As for Jessica, from the moment I set eyes
on her something in her personality repelled me,
though afterwards, at her house, when we had that
lovely music, I felt for the first time less antagonistic.
But if I knew her twenty years I should never get
to like her, or, indeed, trust her. Doesn’t she affect
you in that way?”</p>

<p>“Not in that way, precisely, though I have never
liked her, as you know. I have somehow felt all
the time that she and Stapleton and La Planta were
playing some deep game, and I believe they are
playing it still, whatever it may be. How odd she
should have invited us to tea on her house-boat that
day at Henley, and been so amiable, and yet that
so soon afterwards—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>She checked herself abruptly, and nestled closer
to her lover. The pressure of his strong arm seemed
to give her confidence, restore her courage. After
all, she reflected, so long as they were together, what
could anything matter? And then, carried away
suddenly by her emotion, she flung her arms about
his neck and kissed him again and again.</p>

<p>The sun was setting when at last they rose and
prepared to go back to the village, a couple of miles
distant, where they had left their car.</p>

<p>“Why,” Preston said, suddenly producing a letter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>from his pocket, “I forgot to tell you, dear, I received
this from George just before we came out.
He is staying in town during August, as I think I
told you, and he says he has been again to the house
with the bronze face. While there he was informed
that Mrs. Timothy Macmahon, to whom Lord Froissart
left his fortune, is now in London and has a
strange story to tell. Stothert told George that Mrs.
Macmahon was greatly upset on hearing that Froissart
had bequeathed everything to her, and that she
is anxious to transfer the greater part of the fortune
to Froissart’s rightful heir, his eldest daughter, Mrs.
Ferdinand Westrup, who lives with her husband in
Ceylon. Mrs. Macmahon admits, he says, that she
was on terms of intimacy with Froissart, who used
to visit her in Cashel, her home in Tipperary, but
she declares that was no reason for him to leave
his entire fortune to her, especially as she has a
comfortable income of her own.”</p>

<p>He unfolded the letter and read parts of it aloud
to Yootha as they strolled along the heather. The
paragraph which interested her most, ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“... Stothert also told me Mrs. Macmahon had told
him that Froissart, for some time before he took his
life, had been threatened with exposure of his private
life if he refused to continue to pay increasingly large
sums of money to certain persons who were persecuting
him....”</p>
</div>

<p>Yootha put her hand impulsively on her lover’s
arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
“Charlie!” she exclaimed, “that is exactly what
Cora told me she thought might have been the reason
of Lord Froissart’s suicide. She had heard rumors
of his intimacy with some woman in Ireland, and
that there was possibility of a big scandal, and she
also told me Lord Froissart possessed such a sensitive
nature that she could not imagine what would
happen if the scandal ever came to a head. And
now I have an idea. Don’t you think it possible
Vera Froissart may have discovered her father’s
secret, and that the shock of the discovery may
have driven her, for very shame, to end her life?”</p>

<p>For some moments Preston did not answer. Then
he said:</p>

<p>“My darling, I don’t think that. What I think
far more likely is that Vera may intentionally have
been enlightened concerning her father’s unfortunate
infatuation for Mrs. Macmahon, and herself have
been blackmailed by the very people who afterwards
blackmailed her father, in which case the same
scoundrels are indirectly responsible for the death
of both father and daughter. More, I now suspect
the person or persons who threatened Froissart and
his daughter may be the people now threatening us
if we refuse to intimidate Cora in the way they
wish us to.”</p>

<p>Yootha stopped in her walk, staring speechless
at her companion.</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” she exclaimed at last. “How
can such wretches be allowed to live?”</p>

<p>Then her imagination began to work with extraordinary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>rapidity. She thought of Cora’s secret love
for Sir Stephen Lethbridge, who had shot himself
a year before; of Lord Hope-Cooper, who had
drowned himself in the lake of his beautiful park
at Cowrie Hall, in Perthshire; of Viscount Molesley,
Leonora Vandervelt and others, whose mysterious
suicides had so startled London Society, also of the
well-known men and women who had, quite recently,
ended their lives apparently for no reason. Was it
possible all these people had been driven to desperation
by the same means and finally in a fit of temporary
insanity, destroyed themselves?”</p>

<p>Suddenly she caught her breath.</p>

<p>Henry Hartsilver, the husband of her friend, Cora—&#8203;her
dearest friend! No breath of scandal concerning
him had ever been whispered, and yet—&#8203;—</p>

<p>A sentence she had read in a novel flashed back
into her mind: “The private lives of most men are
sealed books to all but their companion, or companions,
in guilt.”</p>

<p>Had Hartsilver’s private life been a sealed book
to Cora, whose habit it had been, she remembered,
to jest about her husband’s extraordinary respectability?</p>

<p>She clutched her lover’s hand, and stopped again
in her walk.</p>

<p>“Charlie!” she exclaimed in an access of emotion,
“if ever, after we are married, you grow tired
of me—&#8203;I want you—&#8203;I want you to—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>Something seemed to choke her, and Preston
caught her in his arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
“Yootha, Yootha, my own darling!” he exclaimed
huskily. “What are you saying? What are you
thinking about? How can you imagine for a single
instant I could grow tired of you, the one woman
in the world I have ever loved! Don’t say what
you were trying to, whatever it may have been. I
don’t want to hear it. It pains me when you talk
like that, my precious! You don’t—&#8203;you can’t suppose
I should be such a monster as to think of any
woman but you?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but promise—&#8203;you will promise—&#8203;if you feel
your love for me fading, no matter how little, to tell
me about it? I couldn’t bear to think you pretended
to love me when all the time you knew in your heart
that in spite of yourself you were growing tired of
me. So many men grow tired of their wives. Oh,
yes, I have seen it again and again among my own
friends—&#8203;they marry, they love each other truly for
a little while, then their love begins to cool, and
then—&#8203;oh, my darling, the bare thought of that possibility
makes me feel faint and ill,” and she began
to sob bitterly as she lay listless in his arms.</p>

<p>It was now nearly dark, and they were still a
long way from the village. Preston tried to comfort
her, assuring her again and again of the impossibility
of his ever growing tired of her, or indeed loving
her less, but for a long time she remained in deep
depression.</p>

<p>And while this was happening Doctor Johnson and
George Blenkiron were dining together at the former’s
house in Wimpole Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
They had become extremely friendly since their
first meeting at the ball at the Albert Hall, owing
partly to the fact of their having interests in common,
and it was but natural that during dinner
mention should be made of their common friend,
Preston.</p>

<p>“I still feel anxious about Charlie Preston,” Blenkiron
happened to remark. “He has changed greatly
of late, yet won’t say what is the matter. To-day
I heard an odd story to the effect that he has got
himself into some sort of trouble. And yet I can’t
think what. He is not a man who runs after women;
rather, he is inclined to shun them. On the other
hand he is not in monetary difficulties, that I know
for a fact.”</p>

<p>“Where did you hear the story?” Johnson asked.</p>

<p>“At the club. Several men seemed to have heard
it, yet all were vague as to the nature of the alleged
trouble. I do hope, Johnson, he has not done anything
foolish. He is such a good fellow.”</p>

<p>“The last man to do anything foolish, I should
say,” the doctor replied. “I like to trace to their
source the origin of vague stories, because often
they do much mischief though quite devoid of foundation.
Couldn’t we, between us, find whence this
rumor emanates?”</p>

<p>“I think it should be possible. I will see what
can be done to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Blenkiron was fortunate next morning in coming
face to face with the member of the club who had
first told him the story, or the story so far as it
went.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
Briefly, the rumor was that Captain Preston had
been talking too freely about a certain lady—&#8203;this
was the new version—&#8203;that he had been taken to
task by an intimate friend of hers, also a member
of the club, and that an action threatened unless
Preston agreed to apologize in writing for what he
had stated, and, in addition, agreed to pay a considerable
sum to the man who brought the charge.</p>

<p>“Who told you all that?” Blenkiron inquired
carelessly.</p>

<p>“Told me? I’m sure I don’t remember,” his informant
replied quickly. “It is common talk. You
will hear about it everywhere.”</p>

<p>“Still, one ought to know who started it, because,
personally, I don’t believe a word of it. Preston
is not a man to talk indiscreetly, especially about
a woman.”</p>

<p>The other shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I give it, of course, merely for what it is worth,”
he said. “I don’t vouch for the accuracy of everything
I hear.”</p>

<p>“Then why repeat it as if it were solemn truth?
I’d be more careful if I were you, Appleton,” Blenkiron
went on. “There’s a thing called the law of
slander.”</p>

<p>Appleton stared.</p>

<p>“If Preston is a friend of yours,” he stammered,
“I suppose I ought to apologize.”</p>

<p>“I think so too,” Blenkiron answered.</p>

<p>But in spite of his endeavor during the day to
find who had first started the story, he failed to
get any information. Many of his acquaintances
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>had heard the rumor, but none could remember
where.</p>

<p>Yet one person could have enlightened him.
Jessica, scheming to destroy the happiness of those
she knew to be striving to discover the secret of her
past life, had now no scruple as to what methods
she might employ to achieve her end. And for some
weeks events had been occurring which, she now
realized, threatened to jeopardize her position in
Society, and indeed her own safety and that of her
faithful companions.</p>

<p>“Louie,” she said to Stapleton—&#8203;they were at
<i lang="fr">déjeuner</i> with La Planta on the terrace of the Royal
Hotel at Dieppe, “don’t you think it time we put
a check to the activities of Cora Hartsilver and her
energetic admirers? I am growing tired of being
harassed by their over-persistency. If our plan fails
with Preston and Yootha Hagerston regarding her,
I suggest that more repressive measures be resorted
to at once. And I don’t mind admitting now, that
I believe Charles Preston is going to prove too much
for us.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Twenty-one">XXI.</abbr>
</h3>
<h4>THE LITTLE HORSES.
</h4>
</div>

<p>The re-opening of the Casino at Dieppe in 1919 was
the signal, as some may remember, for an outbreak
of gambling for very high stakes. This was attributed
partly to the natural reaction of public feeling
after the roulette tables and the <i lang="fr">petits chevaux</i> had
been so long <i lang="fr">hors concours</i>, and partly to the fact
that during the war many acquired a taste for speculation
who previously had looked upon even a sixpenny
lottery as ungodly.</p>

<p>Among the regular frequenters of the Casino during
August of 1919 was a very handsome Englishwoman,
accompanied almost always by a tall, undistinguished-looking
man of middle-age, and by a
good-looking, well groomed young fellow of twenty-six
or so. Night after night this trio would arrive
between eight and nine o’clock, seat themselves
whenever possible at the same <i lang="fr">petits chevaux</i> table,
until the Casino closed.</p>

<p>What attracted attention to them was the large
sum they invariably staked at every turn of the
wheel which set the horses “running”; the recklessness
of their play, and their extraordinary luck.
Time and again they would come out of the Casino
many hundreds, and sometimes many thousands of
pounds richer than when they had gone in, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>usually an <i lang="fr">agent de police</i> would meet them at the
entrance and accompany them across to their hotel
to prevent any possibility of their being robbed.</p>

<p>Dieppe at that time was one of the few French
seaport towns which could be visited by English
folk without their being compelled first of all to
comply with endless formalities, so that English
people foregathered there in their thousands. It
was not surprising, therefore, that when Jessica and
her friends had been a week or two in the town they
should suddenly come face to face in the Casino with
no other than Captain Preston and his future wife.</p>

<p>Instantly Jessica extended her hand.</p>

<p>“I won’t say it is odd meeting you here,” she
exclaimed, as she shook hands with Yootha, “because
one does nothing but run across friends all
day and every day, but I must say I did not expect
to meet you, for I heard you were both in Monmouthshire.”</p>

<p>“We left Abergavenny two days ago,” Yootha
answered quickly, “and arrived here last night.
Isn’t this a delightful place? I’ve never been here
before.”</p>

<p>“Is anybody with you?” Jessica asked.</p>

<p>“An aunt of mine had arranged to come, but at
the last moment she was detained through illness.”</p>

<p>Though she felt exceedingly uncomfortable at
meeting Jessica again, after all that had occurred,
she deemed it wiser to appear friendly than to cut
the woman—&#8203;her secret wish. Jessica, on the other
hand, seemed really glad to meet Yootha Hagerston
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>once more, and Captain Preston, and when they had
conversed for a little while she inquired where they
were staying, and then invited them to dine, an
invitation they naturally felt compelled to accept.</p>

<p>The Royal Hotel was crowded with well-dressed
people, many of whom went across to the Casino
after dinner, among them Jessica, her friends, and
her two guests.</p>

<p>“I have been so lucky at <i lang="fr">petits chevaux</i> lately,”
Jessica said as they all passed in. “I don’t want to
influence you in any way, Yootha, but if you and
Captain Preston like to play my game I believe you
will win. During the three weeks I have been playing
I have come away a loser only three times, and
not on one occasion a heavy loser. I am between
three thousand and four thousand pounds to the
good on my three weeks’ play, and Louie and Archie
won several thousands each. And yet not one of
us has any system. It is just pure luck.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think Yootha will play,” Preston, who
had overheard Jessica’s remark, cut in.</p>

<p>“Oh, but why not, Charlie?” the girl exclaimed
in a tone of disappointment. “I have been looking
forward so much to playing, though of course I am
not going to gamble.”</p>

<p>Jessica laughed, and in the laughter was a note
of pity, approaching disdain.</p>

<p>“Naturally if Captain Preston forbids you to
play, you won’t play,” she said lightly.</p>

<p>“Indeed you are mistaken, Jessica,” Yootha said
piqued. Then she turned to Preston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
“I am going to play, Charlie,” she said, “and
you will see that I shall win!”</p>

<p>“That’s the spirit,” Jessica laughed, only partly
in jest. “And yet if you lose, dear, you won’t blame
me, I hope.”</p>

<p>Preston bit his lip, but said nothing more. Directly
he had said that Yootha wouldn’t play, he had
realized his want of tact. No woman likes to be
thwarted, least of all before acquaintances, and by
the man she is going to marry. Had he remained
silent she would, he felt sure, have said of her own
accord that she preferred not to play.</p>

<p>He lit a cigar and stood watching the game while
Jessica found seats at the table and made Yootha
take the vacant one beside her. Stapleton and
La Planta stood just behind.</p>

<p>“Give me your money,” Jessica said in an undertone
to the girl. “I will add it to my own, and then
we shall be backing the same horses and my luck,
if I have any, will be yours too.”</p>

<p>With a growing feeling of excitement, Yootha
produced from her handbag a roll of paper money,
counted it carefully, and handed it to her companion.</p>

<p>“That is all I can afford,” she whispered. “You’ll
do the best you can with it, won’t you? I do so
want to win.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that is plenty,” Jessica answered, as she
picked up the notes, and after counting them, placed
them on top of her own sheaf.</p>

<p>Then, for some minutes, she watched the play
closely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
“Now I am going to start,” she said suddenly,
and pushed a heap of paper on to one of the names
of the horses.</p>

<p>The little horses spun around, passing one another,
some gradually dropping back, others overtaking,
the leaders. Then came the monotonous “<i lang="fr">Rien n’va
plus</i>” from the croupier; the horses began to slacken
speed, went slower and slower—&#8203;stopped.</p>

<p>Jessica had lost.</p>

<p>“This time we double,” she said under her breath
to Yootha, and pushed more money on to the name
from which her former stake had just been raked.</p>

<p>Again the horses spun round; again the croupier
droned; again they slowed down—&#8203;and stopped.</p>

<p>Jessica had lost again.</p>

<p>“Had we better go on?” Yootha asked anxiously.
“Or why not try another horse?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” Jessica answered impatiently. “You
have lost only a trifle. I have lost fifty pounds.
Now watch.”</p>

<p>She backed the same horse again, and this time
the heap of notes was much bigger. The race
started. For more than a minute the little horses
kept changing their positions, then they moved
slower and finally stopped.</p>

<p>Yootha uttered an exclamation of delight. The
horse Jessica had backed had won!</p>

<p>A great pile of money, as it seemed to the girl,
was pushed towards Jessica by the croupier, and
at once she passed some of the pile towards her.</p>

<p>The next time the horses started the sum staked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>by Jessica was much bigger, and she won again.
Again she staked, and again she won; and again;
and yet again. The crowd gathered about the table
began to murmur. It grew excited when Jessica,
backing different animals, won three times more in
succession.</p>

<p>By that time Yootha was panting with excitement.
Jessica, as soon as she had realized that her
luck still prevailed, had gone practically nap every
time with Yootha’s money as well as her own.
Yootha’s breast rose and fell, her lips were parted,
her eyes shone strangely as she watched her companion
staking and winning now on almost every
race. If she lost once she won twice. If she lost
twice she won generally three or four times directly
afterwards. Yootha, with her winnings piled in
front of her, was about to speak to Jessica, when
her eyes met Preston’s. Her lover, standing facing
her on the opposite side of the table, was calmly
smoking his cigar. He made no movement, nor
did his expression betray either approval or disapproval.
He merely looked hard at her without
smiling.</p>

<p>“Make Captain Preston come and sit near us,”
Yootha heard Jessica saying. “He looks so sad there
alone. Doesn’t he ever play? Has he no vices at
all? Take my advice, Yootha—&#8203;think twice before
marrying a man who boasts that he has no vices!”</p>

<p>“But he doesn’t boast anything of the sort—&#8203;he
doesn’t boast at all,” Yootha retorted, nettled, for
again Jessica’s tone annoyed her. She caught Preston’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>eye once more and made a sign to him; but
he only shook his head and smiled rather coldly.</p>

<p>“You must teach him to play after you are married,
dear,” Jessica said. “I know that he has
played,” and she smiled oddly. “Look at the sum
you have amassed to-night through taking my
advice. Now I am going to stake again four times,
and, after that, win or lose, we stop.”</p>

<p>She staked heavily, and lost; then staked heavily
again, and won three times in succession.</p>

<p>Then she rose, and Yootha did the same, and at
once other players took their seats.</p>

<p>Yootha was beside herself. Though the sum she
had won was small by comparison with the amount
won by Jessica, to her it seemed a lot, perhaps because
she had never played before.</p>

<p>“Let us go back and win some more,” she exclaimed
excitedly, casting a furtive glance backward
at the table they had just left. “I do love it so!
Are you always as lucky as that, Jessica?”</p>

<p>In the excitement of the moment she seemed quite
to have forgotten her aversion for Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson;
she had even forgotten her lover’s presence
until he suddenly approached.</p>

<p>“Was I not right not to take your advice?” she
said to him gaily. “You ought to have played,
Charlie, you really ought. You have no idea what
fun it is.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I?” he answered, looking down at her.
“I wish I hadn’t—&#8203;I should be a rich man to-day.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Jessica cut in with a curious laugh. “I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>have been told that years ago Captain Preston lost
thousands on the turf and at cards.”</p>

<p>Yootha saw her lover make a little gesture of
annoyance and at once she changed the subject.</p>

<p>At supper in the Casino they were joined by
Stapleton and La Planta, who had disappeared while
Yootha and Jessica were playing. When they were
half-way through the meal, Yootha’s gaze became
fixed on a man at supper with friends at a table
close by. Presently she turned to Preston:</p>

<p>“I know that man so well by sight,” she said, “but
can’t remember who he is, or where I have seen him
before. Haven’t we both met him somewhere?”</p>

<p>Preston cast a hasty glance in the direction indicated.
The person referred to was a sleek, well-nourished
man with black, rather curly hair, and
a carefully waxed moustache. Yes, he too had seen
him before—&#8203;but where?</p>

<p>And then all at once he remembered. He had
not seen him before, but he had seen his portrait.
It hung, quite a large picture, in Stothert’s office
in the house with the bronze face.</p>

<p>He told Yootha so.</p>

<p>“So it does!” she exclaimed. “That is how I
remember the face. I wonder who he is?”</p>

<p>“You wonder who he is?” Jessica inquired; she
had overheard only the last sentence.</p>

<p>“That dark man at supper over there,” and she
indicated his whereabouts with her eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, that is Monsieur Alphonse Michaud,” Jessica
replied at once. “A remarkable character, according
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>to all accounts. He is the director, and I suppose
proprietor of the Metropolitan Secret Agency
in London.”</p>

<p>“That man is? But I thought Mr. Stothert and
the woman called Camille Lenoir were the directors.”</p>

<p>Jessica laughed.</p>

<p>“Have some more lobster, dear,” she said. “No,
Stothert and Lenoir are merely managers, just
salaried people like other managers. But when
have you been to the Metropolitan Agency?”</p>

<p>“I went there at the time of that horrible affair at
the Albert Hall ball, when they thought I had stolen
Mrs. Stringborg’s necklace. I can’t bear to think
of it, even now. It seems like a nightmare still.”</p>

<p>“Of course—&#8203;I had forgotten. By the way, was
that mystery ever cleared up?”</p>

<p>“I believe not. The whole thing was most singular.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t the Metropolitan Agency find out anything?
They are generally so clever.”</p>

<p>“Nothing of importance,” Yootha answered
quickly. “Oh, yes, that is the man,” she said, looking
again at the dark-haired stranger who had just
risen from supper with his friends, three flashily-dressed
women. “There is no mistaking him. The
portrait is a striking likeness.”</p>

<p>When Yootha and Preston were alone again, the
girl returned to the subject of her play.</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> so exciting, Charlie,” she exclaimed. “I
must try my luck again to-morrow, I really must.
In some ways Jessica is a wonderful woman; she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>tells me she nearly always wins, so that by doing
just what she does—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>“You seem suddenly to have taken a fancy to
Jessica,” her lover interrupted. “I never thought
you would do that, dear.”</p>

<p>“Nor did I, Charlie,” she replied at once. “And
I haven’t exactly taken a fancy to her, only I think—&#8203;well,
I think we have misjudged her to some extent.”</p>

<p>“After the things you know she said about Cora?”</p>

<p>“I don’t actually know she said them, because I
didn’t hear her say them. After all, we were only
told she said those things, and you know how people
exaggerate.”</p>

<p>Preston was silent.</p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t play again, darling,” he
suddenly exclaimed earnestly. “You have no idea
how the craving to play can get hold of you. I hoped
so much to-night that you would lose.”</p>

<p>“Hoped that I should lose!”</p>

<p>“Yes, so that you wouldn’t want to play again;
so that you would grow disgusted with the game
before it had time to get a hold on you.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I know why that was,” she exclaimed, her
brow clearing. “Jessica said that years ago you
lost a lot of money. No wonder you hate playing
now. I understand your being disgruntled. How
much did you lose, Charlie? And why did you
never tell me? And who told Jessica?”</p>

<p>“I lost almost every shilling I had,” Preston answered,
lowering his voice. “Otherwise I should be
a rich man to-day, instead of comparatively a pauper.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>The gambling fever caught me first when I was
staying in Port Said, with friends, and I was very
lucky. It increased and increased until, though I
lost again and again, I became absolutely reckless.
I think the craze for gambling is the worst form of
affliction that can befall any man. But I overcame
it in the end, and because I overcame it when too
late I want you to overcome it before you go
further.”</p>

<p>Yootha looked up into his face, and patted his
cheek playfully.</p>

<p>“Charlie,” she said, “I am going to play to-morrow—&#8203;just
to-morrow. I promised Jessica I would. And
now I promise you that if I lose to-morrow I will
never play again. Will that satisfy you? You
know I always keep my promises.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it will have to satisfy me,” her lover
answered, kissing her. “But I hate your becoming
intimate with Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson—&#8203;you don’t
know how I hate it. She is not the right companion
for you at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be anxious,” Yootha replied, smiling.
“I can look after myself, I assure you.”</p>

<h4>ANOTHER MYSTERY MAN.
</h4>
</div>

<p>“You will let me, won’t you?” Jessica said coaxingly.</p>

<p>She was addressing Yootha, begging her to let
her take the place of the aunt who had been detained
at the eleventh hour, and act as her chaperone during
Yootha’s stay at Dieppe.</p>

<p>“I know there have been times when you and
Cora have not thought well of me, I never knew
quite why,” she went on, “and I should like you to
be able to assure Cora that she formed a wrong
opinion of me. I always think someone must have
told her things, and so prejudiced her against me.”</p>

<p>Thus Yootha, always generously disposed, also
impressionable and ready to forgive an injury,
fancied or otherwise, was soon talked over by the
clever woman. Indeed, the girl went so far as to
persuade herself that she and Cora and Preston,
and the others who had tried so hard to discover
Jessica’s antecedents, had suspected her unjustly.
And now on the top of it all had come Jessica’s
introduction of Yootha to the Casino with its <i lang="fr">petits
chevaux</i>, Yootha’s subsequent elation at her success,
and Jessica’s extraction of the promise from her
that she would play again with her next day.</p>

<p>“Though I have been lucky all along, I have never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>been as lucky as I was to-night,” she said to Yootha
as they parted for the night. “I believe you are my
mascot, and to-morrow we will prove if you are or
not!”</p>

<p>Next night Preston excused himself. He said the
Casino bored him; in reality he could not bear
Jessica’s company, or the sight of Yootha gambling.
To have opposed Yootha’s wish further than he had
done would, he knew, have been unwise; she might
have turned upon him and said things she would
afterwards have regretted saying. So with a major
in the Gunners, whose acquaintance he had made at
the Royal Hotel, and who had been through the
war, he started off for an evening walk up the hill
to the back of the town as soon as Jessica and Yootha
had gone across to the Casino, where they were to
meet Stapleton and La Planta.</p>

<p>It was one of those warm, balmy nights, the air
perfectly still, which we enjoy so rarely in this
country. By the time Preston and his companions
had reached the summit of the steep ascent the
moon, in its second quarter, was shining down across
the streets and houses, imparting to the city the
aspect of a toy town, and illuminating the sea for
many a mile beyond it. As they sat contemplating
the picturesque panorama their gaze became focused
on the lights of the Casino.</p>

<p>“Don’t you play at all?” the major, whose name
was Guysburg, inquired as he lit a fresh cigar and
offered one to Preston.</p>

<p>“Not now,” Preston answered dryly. “I played
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>too much in my time; games of chance and backing
horses bit me hard when I was almost a boy.”</p>

<p>The major laughed.</p>

<p>“Boys will be boys,” he said lightly, as he puffed
at his cigar.</p>

<p>“And fools will be fools,” Preston retorted. “I
was one of the fools who ‘made their prayer,’ and
have regretted it ever since.”</p>

<p>“Yet you have no objection to your future wife’s
playing? That seems to me strange.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I have the strongest objection,” Preston
answered quickly, in a strange voice. “I have been
through the mill, and I know what it means when
the craving to gamble gets a grip on you which, try
as you will, you can’t shake off. Unfortunately Miss
Hagerston met an acquaintance here yesterday—&#8203;that
tall, handsome woman—&#8203;you must have noticed
her—&#8203;who last night induced her to play, and they
won a lot of money. Miss Hagerston became so
exultant that she promised Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson
she would play with her again to-night, and nothing
I could say would dissuade her. I can only hope
that to-night their luck will be reversed, and then
Miss Hagerston will see the folly of the whole thing.”</p>

<p>For a minute the major did not reply. Then he
said abruptly:</p>

<p>“Who are the two men who are always in Mrs.
Mervyn-Robertson’s company—&#8203;I think you said
that was her name?”</p>

<p>“Just friends. They are constantly with her in
London too, where she is well-known in Society;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>some say there is no romance or scandal associated
with their friendship; others say there is.”</p>

<p>For a long while they conversed on various topics,
and particularly about the war. Presently the major
said:</p>

<p>“I noticed a person in the hotel to-day who had
a curious reputation before the war—&#8203;a man called
Michaud, Alphonse Michaud. Have you ever heard
of him?”</p>

<p>“Odd, your asking that,” Preston answered. “He
was pointed out to me last night at supper at the
Casino—&#8203;a dark man, rather Jewish looking, with
black wavy hair.”</p>

<p>“That’s the fellow. He was mixed up in several
shady affairs some years before the war, and I understand
he is now ‘commander-in-chief’ of a most
successful inquiry agency in London, with branches
on the Continent and abroad. I suppose it is the
old idea, ‘set a thief to catch a thief,’” and he
laughed.</p>

<p>“What do you know about him?” Preston asked,
suddenly interested. “How the Metropolitan Secret
Agency is so successful in ferreting out secrets in
people’s private lives has long puzzled London
Society, also the London police, and I have often
heard it hinted that the Agency in question of which
I now understand Michaud is the moving force, has
recourse to questionable methods to obtain its information.”</p>

<p>“That I can believe,” Major Guysburg answered,
“if Michaud has to do with it. Mind, he is an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>extraordinarily clever man. One ramp he was generally
supposed eight or ten years ago to have had
a hand in concerned the insurance of some valuable
stones owned by a diamond merchant whose place
of business is in the Kalverstraat in Amsterdam—&#8203;I
formerly lived near Rotterdam. Within six months
after the insurance had been effected the stones disappeared
from the merchant’s safe, and to this day
nobody knows how the robbery was carried out—&#8203;the
merchant kept the key of his safe on him day
and night. The opinion in Amsterdam, however,
was that Michaud, who had insured the stones and
who was paid the insurance under protest, was himself
the thief. Oh, but there were other queer doings
in which he was said to be mixed up, but they would
take too long to tell. Incidentally he was supposed
at one time to have in his possession a remarkable
drug, a sort of perfumed poison, with most peculiar
attributes—&#8203;it was said that the drug, properly administered,
rendered people unconscious, and left
their minds a blank after they recovered consciousness,
from a period before they inhaled it.”</p>

<p>Preston became greatly interested.</p>

<p>“Tell me, major,” he said, “did you read the report
recently of the exhumation of the body of a Jew
who died suddenly, and under rather mysterious
circumstances, at a ball at the Albert Hall?”</p>

<p>“No. I am not a great newspaper reader.”</p>

<p>“Well, naturally I was interested in the affair
because I and a friend of mine found the man dead
in one of the boxes during the ball,” and he went
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>on to give Major Guysburg a brief account of what
had occurred that night. “Why I am interested in
what you say about that peculiar drug is that the
man who was believed to know something about the
Jew’s death, or rather what caused it, admitted having
imported from Shanghai, for his own use only,
he said, a drug apparently similar to the one you
have just mentioned—&#8203;it may, indeed, have been the
identical drug.”</p>

<p>“Shanghai, did you say? Why, I remember now
that is the place where the drug I have told you
about was supposed to have come from.”</p>

<p>“How strange! And there was another affair
when apparently some drug of the sort was used,
but on that occasion the victim was La Planta
himself.”</p>

<p>“La Planta! The name sounds familiar. Now
where have I heard that name before?”</p>

<p>He racked his brain for a minute, but in vain.</p>

<p>“La Planta,” Preston said, “was the man believed
to know something of the cause of the Jew’s death,
but nothing could be proved against him. You may
be surprised to hear that La Planta is the younger
of the two men constantly with the woman we have
just been speaking about, Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? Then are the lady and her two friends
acquainted with Michaud?”</p>

<p>“No, they know him only by sight.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I remember where I have heard of La
Planta before,” Guysburg exclaimed suddenly. “He
represented an insurance company in Amsterdam
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>and was called upon to give expert opinion at the
time of the diamond robbery I have told you about.
Yes, and the company he represented, I remember,
was directed by the late Lord Froissart, who committed
suicide some time ago.”</p>

<p>“Really this is remarkable, Major Guysburg,”
Preston exclaimed. “You and I meet at haphazard,
we happen to go for a walk, and we find that we
each know several things in which the other is
directly interested, and which seem to fit into each
other like bits of a puzzle. Are you staying long in
Dieppe? I should like to talk over several matters
with you, and my future wife would be interested
to hear what you have just told me.”</p>

<p>“And I should be most pleased to tell her. My
intention at present is to stay here a week or ten
days longer. After that I may go to New York.”</p>

<p>It was late when they arrived back at the Royal,
where both were staying, but Yootha had not yet
returned from the Casino. Nor had Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson
come back, they were told at the office.
They had just turned to go into the vestibule when
they came face to face with Alphonse Michaud,
accompanied by the three women Preston had seen
him with the night before.</p>

<p>“Most remarkable thing I have ever known,” he
was saying. “That woman seems to bewitch the
tables.” He turned to the hotel manager who was
passing.</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he said, “do they often break the bank
at your Casino?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
“Break the bank?” the manager repeated with
a smile. “I have been here twenty-two years and
can remember only one occasion when the bank
failed; that must have been fifteen or more years
ago, and the man who broke it was the son of Don
Carlos—&#8203;a little while previously he had won sixty
thousand pounds at Monte Carlo and taken that
sum away. Has any one broken the bank to-night?”
he ended with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Yes, that tall, handsome woman staying here who
is generally accompanied by two men—&#8203;one a middle-aged
man, the other a youth. Who is she?”</p>

<p>“You must mean Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson,” the
manager answered. “You don’t mean to say that
she has broken the bank!”</p>

<p>“She has indeed. She and her two friends and
a girl with them sat down to roulette between half-past
eight and nine, and luck pursued them from the
very outset. We have been watching them for a
long time, and I never saw anything like their luck.
The mere fact of their backing a number seemed to
make the number come up. After a little while the
crush round the table became so great that few besides
those seated were able to play at all. Finally
the croupiers declared the bank was broken, and
that there would be no more play to-night.”</p>

<p>“You will forgive my speaking to you,” Preston
cut in, “but are the people you speak of returning
to the hotel now, do you happen to know? They
are friends of mine.”</p>

<p>Michaud looked hard at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
“Were you not with them at supper at the Casino
last night?” he inquired. “I am sure I saw you
there.”</p>

<p>“Quite likely. I was with them.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are probably on their way back by
now. They were waiting, when I saw them last, for
additional police escort,” and he laughed. “You
ought to have been with them to-night, sir,” he
added. “You have missed the opportunity of a lifetime,
because they all back the same numbers, so
that you would probably have done the same.”</p>

<p>He had hardly stopped speaking when a car drew
up at the hotel entrance, and Jessica and her party
alighted, accompanied by two police officials.</p>

<p>Preston saw at once that Yootha was almost hysterical.
She kept laughing at nothing, and talking
at a great pace the greatest nonsense. In addition
to her bulging bag, she had slung on her arm a
common sack tied at the top with string. Directly
she saw her lover she rushed up to him, flung her
arms about his neck, and kissed him passionately
in front of everybody.</p>

<p>“Allow me to congratulate you, ladies and gentlemen,”
Michaud said with a profound bow. “I have
been watching your play all the evening, and your
luck is the most astonishing thing I have ever seen.
I expect the Casino will be glad to see the last of
you,” and he laughed, “but only the Casino,” and
he ogled Yootha. “Good night, ladies and gentlemen.”
He turned to Preston, “Good night to you,
sir,” and with his three companions, who had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>standing by looking rather sour, he passed through
the vestibule and disappeared.</p>

<p>For a quarter of an hour the party, which now
included Preston and Major Guysburg, remained in
the vestibule talking over the exciting evening. Now
and again guests returning from the Casino would
come up, apologize for speaking, and then offer their
congratulations. The only two who remained calm,
and apparently unaffected by what had happened,
were Preston and the major.</p>

<p>When Preston kissed Yootha good night in the
corridor before they parted for the night, he looked
down at her sadly.</p>

<p>“My darling,” he said, “have you forgotten what
happened that night at Henley? The day is approaching
when it will be necessary for us to do one
thing or the other regarding Cora, and of course
there is only one thing we can do.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean—&#8203;‘only one thing’?”</p>

<p>Preston gazed at her, speechless.</p>

<p>“Jessica,” Yootha went on, “was talking to me
about Cora this evening, and hinted to me things
about her which, if they are true, would tempt me
never to speak to her again. I am inclined to think
we have overrated Cora, and that her alleged friendship
is not wholly disinterested.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Twenty-three">XXIII.</abbr>
</h3>
<h4>A FRIEND INDEED!
</h4>
</div>

<p>While the events described in the preceding chapter
were taking place in Dieppe, Cora Hartsilver was
visiting friends who had a place in Jersey, near
Gorey. They were people she had known intimately
before her marriage, friends of Sir Stephen Lethbridge
whom she had loved so terribly even after
her marriage, but she had not seen them since her
husband’s death, though several times they had
asked her to stay with them.</p>

<p>She was glad to be out of London at last. The
place had begun to pall on her soon after the
Armistice, also her friend, Yootha Hagerston, seemed
gradually to have changed in her manner towards
her in a way she could not exactly describe, but
which she felt. She did not blame Yootha for this
change, though secretly she resented it. She attributed
it to her friend’s engagement, and hoped that
after her marriage Yootha would become her old
self again, for she could not believe that her long
affection for her could have cooled.</p>

<p>One morning among her correspondence she found
a registered letter which mystified and disconcerted
her exceedingly. Unsigned, and with no address, it
ran as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
“The writer possesses nine letters written by you to
the late Sir Stephen Lethbridge, and five written by Sir
Stephen to you, <em>after your marriage to the late Henry
Hartsilver</em>. The former are dated respectively ——” here
followed the dates, also the addresses from which the
letters had been written. “The latter are dated ——”
and then came another list.</p>

<p>“These documents,” the letter continued, “are wholly
compromising, and photographic prints of them all will
be posted in registered envelopes to the whole of your
circle of personal friends and acquaintances unless six
thousand pounds is paid to me on or before the first of
October next. This is no vain threat, and if the contents
of these documents have faded from your memory
the writer can send you photographic prints to confirm
the accuracy of the statements contained in this letter.</p>

<p>“Reply at once by advertisement in the personal
column of <cite>The Morning Post</cite>, and sign it ‘A. B.—from
Y. Z.’”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Cora stared at the letter for a minute, then read
it through again. Written on a typewriter, it had
been posted, according to the postmark, in the
London West Central district. The letters to which
it referred she remembered only too well. They
were all the letters she had written to Sir Stephen
and that he had written to her during the time she
had been married and while her husband was alive.</p>

<p>She was alone in her room, and she sat down on
the bed and began to think. Who in the world could
have obtained possession of those letters, especially
those she had received? Some servant? Mentally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>she reviewed the various servants who had been in
her employment during the past years, but none
seemed the sort likely to steal letters or attempt to
levy blackmail.</p>

<p>Then, all at once, she remembered Yootha’s telling
her long ago, one day when they had been talking
in confidence about poor Stephen Lethbridge’s sad
end, that her father had told her that strange-looking
men and women had been in the habit of visiting
Sir Stephen at Abbey Hall, in his place in Cumberland,
shortly before his death. She wondered now,
as she had wondered then, who those people could
have been, and why they had visited Sir Stephen.</p>

<p>But that, after all, she now reflected, was not of
moment. What did matter was that her letters
should be in the keeping of someone determined to
do her an injury which would affect the whole of her
future life if she refused to buy them back at the
sum named in the letter she held in her hand.</p>

<p>For a quarter of an hour or more she sat there,
pondering deeply. She had received in the course
of her life several hard knocks, and not once had
her spirit failed her. It came back to her now that
Stephen had more than once warned her to be more
careful about what she put in writing; but then, she
reflected, had he not himself been almost as reckless
every time he wrote to her? Both were emotional
by nature; both were highly imaginative, and they
became carried away by their feelings when in correspondence
with each other.</p>

<p>That her anonymous correspondent had not exaggerated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>when he declared the letters to be “wholly
compromising,” she well knew. Indeed, at the recollection
of some of the violent love passages they
contained she shuddered. What would become of
her, she wondered feverishly, if those passages,
written in her handwriting, or Sir Stephen’s, were
to become public property? Oh, how mad she had
been to write such things, she exclaimed aloud. The
one drop of comfort in her bitterness was the reflection
that Henry no longer lived, that he would never
know.</p>

<p>Henry!</p>

<p>As she spoke her husband’s name a strange
thought flashed in upon her. The mystery of his
suicide had never been fathomed, nor had she ever
succeeded in puzzling out even a possible solution
to the problem, and now, all at once—&#8203;—</p>

<p>Her brain began to work with extraordinary rapidity.
During his lifetime he had often read her curtain
lectures which had bored her almost to distraction—&#8203;he
had never tired of impressing upon her his
views regarding married women who carried on flirtations,
and his opinion in general upon a wife’s
duties to her husband. At first, when he had spoken
thus, her conscience had cried aloud, and she had
believed herself a hypocrite and not fit to be married
to any honest man, seeing that she loved Stephen
Lethbridge so madly.</p>

<p>Then, as time went on, she had succeeded in
smothering her conscience by reminding herself that
Henry had married her in reality against her will,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>therefore that she had a right to love Stephen if
she chose. Later, she had gone a step further by
cultivating the habit of analyzing her feelings calmly
and dispassionately, and contrasting her lack of
affection for her husband with her all-consuming
passion for Sir Stephen, and more than once when
so engaged she had secretly wondered what would
happen to Henry, and for that matter to herself,
should Henry by any terrible mishap discover her
deep secret.</p>

<p>“I believe,” she recollected saying to herself once,
“he would either kill Stephen and me, or end his
own life.”</p>

<p>And now in a flash the thought had come to her—&#8203;could
Henry have, by some means, become aware
of her hypocrisy, of the mental double life she had
been leading, and in a moment of frenzy at his
sudden disillusionment deliberately have ended his
existence? And if so, was it possible the writer of
the anonymous letter she had just received had been
the person to impart that information to her husband,
presumably in the hope of extorting blackmail
by threatening to make the facts public, and
that Henry had in consequence taken his life?</p>

<p>A terrible thought, yet the longer she dwelt on it
the more plausible the theory appeared to her to be.
Quite likely, too, she reflected, that if this were so
the scoundrel, foiled in his first attempt to extort
payment for the letters, would presently make another
attempt, but that before doing so he would
let a reasonable period elapse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
This discovery, as she believed it to be, and the
reflection that now she must either pay the sum
demanded or stand disgraced before everybody she
knew, drove her almost frantic. In her agony of
mind she began to pace the room, trying in vain to
evolve some means of escape from her unknown
persecutor.</p>

<p>Then she began to ask herself whom she could
consult, of whom she could take counsel? And
again there was nobody. Had the matter been one
of less delicacy, less secret, she knew several people,
intimate friends others, to whom she would readily
have unbosomed herself. But to admit to anyone,
even her dearest friend, that she had virtually been
carrying on an intrigue, even an harmless intrigue,
while married, she felt would be impossible. Besides,
would anybody, not excepting her dearest friend,
believe the intrigue to have been harmless?</p>

<p>Suddenly she stopped pacing the room. She had
read in the Jersey paper that morning that on the
previous day a Doctor Johnson—&#8203;the Doctor Johnson
whom she had before consulted on very secret
matters—&#8203;had arrived from Weymouth by the ss.
<cite>Ibex</cite> and gone to the Brees Hotel.</p>

<p>The news had afforded her extreme satisfaction,
and she had said to herself at once that they must
meet again. Now she remembered how kind and
considerate he had been on the occasions when she
had sought his advice. Also he was a doctor, and
doctors were accustomed to receiving confidences
which they never, in any circumstances, disclosed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>she reflected. Supposing she were to approach him
with reference to this dreadful affair, tell him exactly
what had happened, how, though married, she
had been hopelessly, though harmlessly, in love with
the late Sir Stephen Lethbridge, and if then she
were to show him the letter she had received that
day threatening her with blackmail—&#8203;—</p>

<p>Somehow she felt she would be able to trust him
implicitly, and that his advice would be sound, so
on the following afternoon, after telephoning that
she wished to see him particularly, she called at the
Brees and was at once shown up.</p>

<p>The doctor was frankly glad to see her, and
gratified when he found that she wished to consult
him on an unprofessional matter.</p>

<p>“I had a letter from Preston the other day,” he
said, when they had conversed for a few minutes,
“and he seems to have recovered his health and
spirits considerably. I suppose you know that
Jessica and her inseparables are staying at the
hotel in Dieppe where he is; but you may not have
heard that they and Miss Hagerston succeeded between
them in breaking the bank at the Casino some
nights ago.”</p>

<p>“I had not heard that Jessica was there at all,”
Cora answered. “But then I have not heard from
Yootha since she went there—&#8203;she wrote to me last
from Monmouthshire. But surely you are mistaken,
doctor, in saying that she helped Jessica and her
friends to break the bank? Yootha was barely on
speaking terms with Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson the
last time she wrote to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
“Indeed I am not mistaken, Mrs. Hartsilver,”
Johnson replied with an odd look. “Between
ourselves, I rather wish I were, because, as you know,
I am not partial to that woman. Preston told me
in his letter that she and Miss Hagerston had
suddenly become extraordinarily friendly, and he
seemed a good bit upset about it. They all met by
accident at the Royal Hotel, it seems, and Mrs.
Mervyn-Robertson induced Miss Hagerston to play
with her at the tables at the Casino, and they had
the most amazing luck—&#8203;even before they broke the
bank. Miss Hagerston, he says, has become bitten
by the gambling mania, and you know what that
means—&#8203;or perhaps you don’t; I hope you don’t.”</p>

<p>It was some time before Cora could brace herself
to broach the subject on which she had come to
consult Doctor Johnson. She had been silent for
a minute, feeling extremely embarrassed, when suddenly
she said:</p>

<p>“I have come to see you, Doctor Johnson, to ask
your advice on a matter I feel I couldn’t speak
about to anybody else, and of course you will treat
what I am going to say as strictly confidential.
Doctor, I am in very great trouble.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to hear that,” he answered quietly.
“I take it you mean mental trouble.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Perhaps before I say more you had better
read this,” and quickly producing the anonymous
letter from her bag, she handed it to him.</p>

<p>He read it through calmly, his face immobile.
Then he read it again. After that he folded it and
handed it back to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
“An unfortunate incident,” he observed as he
lit a cigarette. “Have you any idea who the writer
is?”</p>

<p>“Not the slightest.”</p>

<p>“A woman, I should say, possibly in league with
some man. You won’t pay, of course.”</p>

<p>“But then what am I to do? Think what will
happen if I don’t pay, doctor!”</p>

<p>“Am I to conclude from that that the allegation
is true? Did you write the letters, and were the
others written to you?”</p>

<p>Cora colored violently, and looked down.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>“That is a pity,” the doctor answered. “Still
Mrs. Hartsilver, even the best of us make mistakes
at times, and when a mistake has been made the
only thing to do is to think of the best way of
avoiding unpleasant consequences. I know perhaps
better than you do how on occasions a woman’s
heart can temporarily overrule her brain and better
judgment, and for that reason I look leniently on
what I call ‘heart influence.’ Did your husband
know anything of this? You will, I am sure, in the
circumstances forgive my asking.”</p>

<p>“So far as I know, he knew nothing,” Cora answered
quickly. “But since receiving that letter I
have wondered if he could, by some means, have
found out, or if someone can have told him, and
whether—&#8203;whether it can have been that knowledge
which drove him to end his life.”</p>

<p>“I think that is possible, Mrs. Hartsilver; yet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>I don’t consider you are to blame. I have learned
several things concerning your marriage, why you
married a man you never loved, and why—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>“Who told you that?” Cora interrupted. “Oh,
Doctor Johnson, how did you find out?”</p>

<p>“That is not of consequence, nor is the fact of
your husband taking his life of consequence now.
The past is finished and done with. What matters
to-day—&#8203;the only thing that matters—&#8203;is what is
going to happen in the immediate future.”</p>

<p>He paused, and then continued:</p>

<p>“You say you want my advice, but if I give it
I shall expect you, mind, to follow it.”</p>

<p>“You may depend on my doing that.”</p>

<p>“Good. My advice, then, is that you do not,
in any circumstances, pay this hush money, or pay
any hush money at all. The writer of the letter
you have shown me is almost for certain a professional
blackmailer, perhaps the only class of criminal
to get, in this country, what he deserves when
caught. What we must do then is set a trap for
him—&#8203;or her. And that I think I can do successfully,
because I did it comparatively recently with most
satisfactory results in a somewhat similar case. Do
you remember Lord Froissart’s suicide, and before
that his daughter’s suicide, Mrs. Hartsilver?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I do.”</p>

<p>“Blackmail in each case, though it was never
made public. I am speaking to you now in strictest
confidence; both are dead, or I should not tell even
you. Poor Vera Froissart fell madly in love with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>scoundrel, who wronged her and subsequently attempted
to blackmail her. Afraid to tell anybody,
she let terror of exposure prey upon her mind until
in a moment of actual madness she made away
with herself. Some time after her death the same
scoundrel approached her father, Lord Froissart,
told him why his daughter had ended her life, and
threatened exposure if Froissart refused to pay.</p>

<p>“Froissart paid. He paid again, and then a
third time. He was not a man of much backbone,
or of strong mentality. When the blackguard to
whom he had already paid thousands came to him
again for a further sum, Froissart, believing that
he must in the end be reduced to beggary through
the man’s extortions, went down to Bournemouth
and threw himself off the cliff.</p>

<p>“The night before he had written a number of
letters at his club—&#8203;the Junior Carlton. One of
those letters was addressed to me—&#8203;I was his medical
adviser. In it he told me everything, and directly
I had read the letter I burnt it, as he wished me
to do. This is the first time I have revealed his
secret, and it is the last time I shall speak of it. I
have revealed it to you that it may serve as a
warning of what may happen if ever you are so
unwise as to pay hush money to anybody. Froissart
had mentioned the name of his persecutor, and with
some trouble I got the man arrested and convicted.
He is in penal servitude to-day, and will be for some
years.”</p>

</div>

<p>Doctor Johnson’s optimism and words of encouragement
set Cora’s mind at rest to some extent,
but she still felt anxious. She did not expect to be
back in England for several weeks, and Johnson
had told her that he intended to remain in Jersey
about the same length of time. What, she asked
herself, would happen meanwhile if she ignored the
anonymous letter, as he advised? True, he had
pointed out that the writer of the letter could
have no desire to ruin her good name, and that she
threatened only in order to terrorize her into paying
the money. If she did not reply in the <cite>Morning
Post</cite>, her persecutor would, he had assured her, write
her another letter before taking any action. Indeed,
he had declared that she would probably receive several
letters before the writer attempted to carry out
her threat.</p>

<p>“And remember,” he had ended, “the more
letters you get, and the more they threaten, the more
evidence you possess to help to convict the villainess
when she is arrested. Give her as much rope as
possible, then strike hard and suddenly.”</p>

<p>They had wandered a considerable way along the
sea wall, which runs beside the coast, one evening
some days later, when Johnson happened to remark:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
“Whom do you think I ran across in the gardens
at the Pomme d’Or, Mrs. Hartsilver? Why, the
young journalist, Harry Hopford. He was in high
spirits, as he generally is, and told me he had been
here several days, spending his holiday. When I
mentioned that you were here too, he became quite
excited, and said he ‘did hope’ he would have the
pleasure of seeing you again. He is meeting me
at the Pomme d’Or to-night. Won’t you join us?
It is a Bohemian little place, but I can call for you,
and I think you will be amused.”</p>

<p>But Cora explained it would be impossible, as the
friends with whom she was staying were giving a
dinner party, she said, from which she could not
well absent herself.</p>

<p>“I only wish I could come,” she added with
sincerity. “It would amuse me more than meeting
a lot of people I don’t know, and have no particular
wish to know. And I should like to see Mr. Hopford
again, too. He has always been so kind.”</p>

<p>Hopford was full of news when he met the doctor
at the Pomme d’Or that evening.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me, Johnson,” was one of his first
questions, “why Captain Preston now always carries
about a loaded automatic?”</p>

<p>“I had no idea he did,” the doctor replied in
surprise. “Who told you?”</p>

<p>“Well,” Hopford answered, “I happened to find
it out, and in rather a curious way. In The Mitre,
off Fleet Street, the other day, I got into conversation
with quite a good fellow who had served during
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>the war. We had one or two drinks together, and
then he mentioned incidentally that a Captain Preston
had been his company commander. When I
told him that I, too, had served under Preston, he
became quite communicative. Preston seems to
be a sort of hero in his eyes. He told me all that
Preston did during the war—&#8203;he has a fine record,
Johnson—&#8203;and then added:</p>

<p>“‘They ought to put him in Ireland—&#8203;he always
has a loaded automatic in his pocket.’</p>

<p>“I inquired the reason, and he went on:</p>

<p>“‘I can’t say, but during Henley regatta he told
me to keep his pistol loaded, and a week later he
took to carrying it about with him.’</p>

<p>“The fellow had told me he was Preston’s servant.</p>

<p>“‘Does he expect to be attacked?’ I then asked
jokingly. And he answered quite seriously, ‘Yes,
I think he does.’</p>

<p>“‘And by whom?’ I said, becoming interested.</p>

<p>“He looked about him, then replied under his
breath: ‘I don’t know, but he told me once he
had met some queer folk in China, in Shanghai,
and I’ve a notion some of those folk may now be
in London and have some sort of a down on him.’”</p>

<p>“Did he say anything more?” Johnson inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes. He said he was worried about ‘the Captain,’
thought he ought not to marry, and hinted
there was a mystery of some sort about the lady
he meant to marry, meaning Miss Hagerston, of
course. By the way, Johnson, I suppose you read
in the papers that Miss Hagerston and Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>La Planta, and Stapleton, between them
broke the bank at the Casino at Dieppe the other
night?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t read about it, but I heard about it.”</p>

<p>“And that reminds me,” Hopford went on, “that
I have heard queer rumors about Preston lately.
A bank clerk I know, who often gives me scraps
of exclusive news, and has never yet let me down,
assures me that Preston is being blackmailed. It’s
a long story and rather complicated.”</p>

<p>“What, more blackmail?”</p>

<p>“How do you mean ‘more’ blackmail?” Hopford
asked quickly, ever on the alert for news.</p>

<p>“I was thinking of a case I heard of the other
day,” Johnson replied, anxious to cover his slip
of the tongue.</p>

<p>Hopford looked at him hard.</p>

<p>“What the clerk told me,” he said a moment
later, “was that Preston would be driven, if not
careful, to pay hush money—&#8203;he mentioned a big
sum—&#8203;to some woman who threatens to reveal something
queer about that beautiful Mrs. Hartsilver.
I saw Preston not long ago, and thought he looked
ill and worried. Have you heard anything by any
chance?”</p>

<p>“If I had I shouldn’t tell a journalist,” Johnson
answered with a smile. “No, not even you, Hopford.”</p>

<p>The lad laughed.</p>

<p>“And I can’t blame you,” he said, “though personally
when I promise not to print news told me
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>in confidence I never do print it. But there are a
lot of little mysteries we both know about which
have not yet been cleared up, and somehow several
seem to me to be directly or indirectly connected
with one another.</p>

<p>“First, there was the epidemic of unaccountable
suicides between a year and eighteen months ago,
when Lord Hope-Cooper, Sir Stephen Lethbridge,
Viscount Molesley, Lord Froissart and his daughter,
that queer woman, Leonora Vandervelt, Henry
Hartsilver, and half-a-dozen more put an end to
themselves apparently for no reason, and then
there was the second epidemic of the same sort
only a month or two ago.</p>

<p>“In addition there are the queer stories concerning
Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson and her two inseparables;
Levi Schomberg’s strange death; the
rumors to do with Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson’s husband—&#8203;some
say he is alive and some say he isn’t;
that affair regarding La Planta’s being obviously
drugged, though to this day nobody knows who
drugged him, why he was drugged, or even where
he was drugged; Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson’s fainting
fit at her own house on the same night, followed
by the theft of her jewels; the robbery and recovery
at the Albert Hall ball of Mrs. Stringborg’s
necklace; Stapleton’s anxiety that the theft of Mrs.
Robertson’s jewels should be attributed to Mrs.
Hartsilver; oh, and several other things.</p>

<p>“The clerk I mentioned just now also told me
that at one time Archie La Planta represented an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>insurance firm in Amsterdam of which Lord Froissart
was the principal director, and that before his
death Froissart had been a good deal upset at
what seems to have been a trick played upon his
Company by some of the policy holders—&#8203;apparently
they insured valuable jewels and uncut precious
stones which subsequently were stolen by the very
men who had insured them, or rather by some of
their accomplices; but as nothing could be proved
the Company had to pay the full claim, though it
did so under protest. Altogether, Johnson, there is
a good deal I want to find out, but it will be a
fine scoop for my paper if I succeed, and I feel
confident I shall do so when I get to Paris.”</p>

<p>“You did not tell me you were going to Paris,”
Johnson said, smiling at the lad’s enthusiasm. “Or
for that matter that you meant to try to solve the
bunch of problems you have just enumerated.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I?” Hopford exclaimed. “Well, that is
the idea. I am here for a short holiday, then I
go to Paris where I have a friend on the staff of
<cite>Le Matin</cite>, an extraordinarily clever fellow with a
genius for putting together puzzles of this sort. He
was in London last month, and when in course of
conversation I chanced to speak about the two
epidemics of suicide there had been among our
society people, and mentioned the names of some
of the victims, he became greatly interested, and
started asking me all sorts of questions.</p>

<p>“He referred to the subject several times again
while in town, and finally told me that if I could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>go to Paris he thought he would be able to put me
on to at least one useful clue, and suggested we
might work the thing together—&#8203;the subject would
interest <cite>Le Matin</cite> too, he said. Thereupon I consulted
my chief who, though skeptical as to the
likelihood of my succeeding, gave me leave to go
to Paris for a week or two. Tell me, Johnson,
have you any friends there who might be of use
to me?”</p>

<p>The doctor pondered for some moments.</p>

<p>“Where are you going to stay in Paris?” he asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>“I stayed at the Brighton in the Rue de Rivoli
the last time I was there,” Hopford answered, “but
I thought this time of finding some little place in
Clichy—&#8203;my friend lives in Montmartre. Why do
you ask?”</p>

<p>“A friend of mine, a mental specialist—&#8203;incidentally
he is interested in your sort of work, and
is wonderfully shrewd in putting two and two together—&#8203;has
a quaint little <i lang="fr">appartement</i> in the
rather slummy Rue des Petits Champs, near the
Place Jeanne d’Arc. If you would like to stay with
him I know he would like to have you, and I feel
confident you would hit it off together. He and I
shared a house in Hong Kong, when I practiced
there, and after a while I appointed him my <i lang="la">locum
tenens</i> in Shanghai.”</p>

<p>“Shanghai!”</p>

<p>Hopford seemed suddenly interested. For several
seconds he did not speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
“Curious coincidence that,” he said at last. “I
just wanted to meet someone who knew Shanghai,
and I had forgotten you had lived in Hong Kong.”</p>

<p>“The friend I speak of knows Shanghai inside
out, which I am afraid I don’t,” Johnson answered.
“Shall I give you an introduction to him?”</p>

<p>“I wish you would, Johnson,” Hopford answered
eagerly. “And under the circumstances I should
like to stay with him, if he will have me. Do you
happen ever to have known a man in Shanghai
named Fobart Robertson?”</p>

<p>“I should say so!” his companion exclaimed.
“One of the worst—&#8203;a mere adventurer. He
married—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>He checked himself.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson!” Hopford said excitedly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t say so,” Johnson replied, slightly put
out by the young man’s rapidity of thought.</p>

<p>“You didn’t say so, but you mean it—&#8203;and you
know it was so!” Hopford observed triumphantly.
“This is splendid! The parts of the puzzle are
fitting themselves in just as I expected they would.
Now I wonder if you knew another man out East,
in Shanghai or Hong Kong, or some place of that
sort, whose name was Timothy Macmahon? When
Lord Froissart committed suicide he left the whole
of his fortune to a Mrs. Macmahon, who is Timothy
Macmahon’s widow.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Macmahon, too, lived in Shanghai at one
time; also Julius Stringborg, who now lives in Upper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>Bruton Street, and was a spirit merchant in Shanghai
and Hong Kong when I practiced out there—&#8203;husband
of the woman whose necklace was stolen
at the Albert Hall ball and who charged Miss Hagerston
with the theft, if you remember. But, as I
say, my former <i lang="la">locum tenens</i> who now lives in Paris
is the man you want to meet if you are seeking
information about former British residents in Shanghai.
Before you leave Jersey I will give you a letter
addressed to him.”</p>

<p>“That’s awfully good of you, Johnson,” Hopford
said in a tone of deep gratitude. “You have no
idea how keen I am to solve the problem of all
these mysteries, as much out of personal curiosity
as from a natural desire to score a newspaper scoop.”</p>

<p>For a long time they continued to converse, and
the more they talked the more deeply impressed
Johnson became by the young man’s exceptional
acumen.</p>

<p>“If at any time you should hear any gossip
concerning Mrs. Hartsilver, Hopford,” he presently
said carelessly, “you might let me know in confidence.”</p>

<p>Hopford turned quickly.</p>

<p>“Why,” he exclaimed. “I have heard gossip about
her already, and I don’t believe a word of it. Shall
I tell you what it is? Of course you won’t repeat
it.”</p>

<p>“Of course. What have you heard?”</p>

<p>The anxiety his tone betrayed was not lost upon
the young journalist, though Johnson had tried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>to conceal it. Instantly he concluded the doctor
must be interested in the young widow. “Yes,”
he commented mentally, “obviously deeply interested.”</p>

<p>“Well, what I have heard,” he said, “came from
two sources, and was to the effect that Preston and
Mrs. Hartsilver were together trying to conceal
some secret of a rather scandalous nature. But, as
I say, I don’t believe a word of it.”</p>

<p>“From whom did you hear it?”</p>

<p>“From two fellows in the office—&#8203;two of our reporters.
As you know, or perhaps you don’t know,
reporters never give away their source of information,
and I told them both to their faces that I knew
Mrs. Hartsilver personally, and was convinced the
story was a lie.”</p>

<p>“What did they say to that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they laughed. One of them said that naturally
in the circumstances my opinion must be
biased, and that subsequent events would show if
the report were true or not.”</p>

<p>“They won’t publish anything in the newspaper,
will they?” Johnson asked; and Hopford was again
struck by the anxiety in his voice and face.</p>

<p>“Set your mind at rest on that point,” he replied.
“They dare not. Even if the tale were true, to
publish it might be libelous. Certainly I will tell
you at once, Johnson, if I hear anything more.”</p>

<p>It was nearly closing time at the Pomme d’Or,
and they rose to go.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Twenty-five">XXV.</abbr>
</h3>
<h4>THE CITY OF SMILES.<br>
</h4>
</div>

<p>Paris has greatly changed since the war. The <i lang="fr">bonhomie</i>
of the boulevards, so marked a feature before
the year 1914, has subsided a good deal. The inhabitants,
considered collectively, are more serious.</p>

<p>Hopford and Johnson’s friend, Idris Llanvar,
with whom Hopford was now staying, were discussing
these and other matters one morning in
Paris, when they were joined by Hopford’s friend
who worked for <cite>Le Matin</cite>. Tall, slim, good-looking,
and with the charming manner peculiar to descendants
of the old French noblesse, he raised his hat
as he approached, then apologized in excellent
English for his unpunctuality.</p>

<p>“We had a fire at the office of <cite>Le Matin</cite>,” he
said, “which almost prevented the paper from coming
out; but thanks to the courtesy of the <cite>Journal des
Débats</cite>, which afforded us facilities for printing, the
situation was saved at the eleventh hour.”</p>

<p>He poured himself out a glass of wine from the
bottle on the table—&#8203;they were sitting outside a café
on the Boulevard des Italiens—&#8203;and continued:</p>

<p>“I have a proposal to make to you, Hopford,
and to you, too, monsieur,” he said, turning to
Idris Llanvar, “which, if it meets with your approval,
may have a rather important result. I understand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>from my friend Hopford here that we three are to
put our heads together to try to make certain discoveries
which, if we succeed, will create something
of a sensation when made public. I have already
told Hopford I know of certain happenings in Paris
which, I believe, bear directly on affairs which have
occurred in London within the past year or two,
and more particularly recently. Now, two friends
of mine belong to the Secret Service Police of Paris,
and what they don’t know concerning the movements
and methods of international criminals is, as you
say in England, not worth knowing. One is a man,
the other a woman. They are coming to me to-night,
and I hope you will both come along too,
so that the five of us may discuss certain affairs.
Will that suit you both?”</p>

<p>And so, late that night, four men and a woman,
all of exceptionally keen intelligence, endowed with
the peculiar attributes which go to the making of
a clever police detective or a successful newspaper
reporter, were gathered together in a small room
in one of those quaint, low-roofed houses with
which visitors to the Quartier Latin are familiar.</p>

<p>The woman was an odd-looking person of about
twenty-eight or twenty-nine, with hair cut short
like a man’s, a pale face, firm lips, and dark, extremely
shrewd eyes. She bore the reputation, Hopford’s
friend said, of possessing more dogged perseverance
than any other member of the Paris detective
force. During the war, he told them, she
had succeeded in bringing no less than seven spies
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>to book without any assistance whatever, all of
whom had eventually been put to death.</p>

<p>Hopford had finished giving the assembled party
all the information he possessed concerning the
two epidemics of suicide in London; the various
thefts which had occurred in connection with this
narrative; and other matters with which the reader
is acquainted, and was lighting a fresh cigar, when
the woman, after a pause, inquired:</p>

<p>“This Madame Vandervelt who threw herself out
of the hotel window. When did that happen?”</p>

<p>Hopford mentioned the date. He had all data
at his fingers’ ends.</p>

<p>“I knew Leonora Vandervelt,” she said. “For
months we shared an <i lang="fr">appartement</i> close to the Madeleine.
By that means I became intimate with her;
and eventually I discovered something I wanted
to know about her—&#8203;at that time she masqueraded
under an assumed name. Finally I brought about
her arrest, and she was sentenced to a year’s imprisonment,
though she deserved three years.
Upon her release she left France, and I lost sight
of her. This is the first time since then that I
have heard of her. I did not know she was dead.
At one time she and Angela Robertson of Shanghai
were close friends. Then they quarreled, parted
in anger, and Angela Robertson, whom you call
Jessica Mervyn-Robertson, declared in my hearing
she would be revenged—&#8203;revenged for what I did
not know. That, of course, was before Vandervelt
went to prison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
“When Vandervelt became suspected of larceny,
I went at once to Angela Robertson, who then lived
in Paris, and placed all the facts before her. As
I expected, she jumped at the chance of getting
her revenge, and largely through the information
she gave me I was able to bring Leonora Vandervelt
to book. And now you tell me Vandervelt committed
suicide. Of course I know who made her
do it. It was Angela Robertson again.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?” Hopford inquired. He
had listened attentively to every word.</p>

<p>“No matter. You will gather that later. Do you
know how Mrs. Robertson comes to be so rich?”</p>

<p>“Through levying blackmail I should imagine,”
Hopford answered quickly.</p>

<p>“As you say, through levying blackmail. She
and her companions you have told me about, Archie
La Planta and Aloysius Stapleton, are three of the
most cunning and persistent blackmailers in your
country. They have practiced the ‘art’ in Continental
capitals, and now reside in London because
your countryfolk are the most easy to blackmail,
also because they have much money and are easily
induced to part with it. You say she pretends to
be Australian. She is not Australian, nor has she
been in Australia, though she had a married sister
living in Monkarra, in Queensland, years ago, governess
to the children of a rich sheep farmer there.
When Mrs. Robertson and Stapleton left Shanghai
for good they went first to Amsterdam, where they
became acquainted with Archie La Planta, a rogue in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>every way, though a charming man to talk to. At
that time he was representing a British insurance
company in Amsterdam.”</p>

<p>“Controlled by Lord Froissart,” Hopford put in.</p>

<p>“Yes. Controlled by the late Lord Froissart.
While there,” she went on, “La Planta was introduced
to Angela Robertson and to Stapleton by a
man named Alphonse Michaud, of whose occupation
the less said the better. Finally the four lived together
at an hotel in the Kalverstraat, the name of
which has for the moment escaped me.”</p>

<p>“That is curious,” Hopford exclaimed, “because
when Mrs. Robertson and Michaud came face to
face in Dieppe the other day, they apparently did
not know each other. A friend of mine, Captain
Preston, said so in a letter to Doctor Johnson.”</p>

<p>“Not Captain Charles Preston who is going to
marry a girl called Yootha Hagerston?” the other
detective asked quickly, now speaking for the first
time.</p>

<p>“That is the man,” Hopford replied. “I served
under him during the war, and I know Miss Hagerston
too.”</p>

<p>The detective glanced across at his female colleague.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that a coincidence?” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh, coincidences never surprise me,” she answered
with a shrug.</p>

<p>“But it points to further collusion,” the man said.</p>

<p>“Then I take it,” Llanvar put in, “there exists
in London at the present time, and has existed for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>a year or more, some sort of organization for extorting
money in considerable sums from rich and well-known
people by means of direct or indirect blackmail?”</p>

<p>“Not only that,” the woman answered. “I am
in a position to know that some members of the
organization have levied blackmail on each other.
There is no honor among miscreants of that type.
They would blackmail their own parents if they
got the chance, and could benefit. Such people
deserve life sentences. Yet in spite of the cunning
and cleverness of this particular gang I think we
are on the right road to tracking them all down
now, although they do pretend to belong to the
best society, and no doubt have influential friends.”</p>

<p>Hopford felt elated as he wandered homeward
that night, arm in arm with his host, the mental
specialist, Idris Llanvar. Each member of the
little gathering had, during the informal conference,
contributed some link, or part of a link, to the chain
of evidence they were forging between them to
justify steps being taken to arrest Jessica and the
people whom they now knew beyond doubt to be
her accomplices in crime.</p>

<p>The town of Singapore had been mentioned
incidentally, and Llanvar had provided some useful
data. Angela Robertson and Fobart Robertson
her husband, Timothy Macmahon, Julius Stringborg,
and his wife Marietta, Aloysius Stapleton, and two
or three more had apparently, when living in Shanghai,
formed an exclusive little clique concerning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>which the strangest of rumors had been rife. The
rumor most commonly credited was that the clique
was actively interested in the secret exportation of
a peculiarly potent drug said to possess several remarkable
attributes. To what country or countries
they exported it, nobody had been able to discover,
but “on good authority” it was declared that
high officials in Shanghai, Hong Kong and other
important ports were in the habit of receiving heavy
bribes not to notice what was happening.</p>

<p>Llanvar himself, he said, had once been indirectly
approached by a native acting obviously on the
instructions of some European, with a view to the
possibility of his benefiting financially if, “as a
matter of form,” he would sign his name to certain
documents which would be brought to him secretly.
He had pretended to consent, hoping thereby to discover
what was happening, but nothing further had
transpired, from which he concluded, he said, that
the members of the clique had decided not to trust
him.</p>

<p>Hopford and Llanvar sat talking in the latter’s
sitting-room over a whisky and soda before going
to bed. Mostly they discussed the affairs of the
evening; but from one subject to another they
drifted until presently Hopford said:</p>

<p>“I wonder Johnson has never married, Llanvar.
He is such a good fellow, and the sort of man women
like, and he must be fairly well off.”</p>

<p>For some moments his host remained silent.</p>

<p>“Well, he wouldn’t mind my telling you, I think,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>he said at last, “but in point of fact he was badly
turned down some years ago by a girl, I think
between ourselves he was fortunate not to marry.
He was terribly in love with her, though, and it
took him a long time to recover from the disappointment;
I doubt if he has really recovered from it
yet. He told me all about it once, and I think the
confidence relieved his mind to some extent. It is
bad to brood in complete silence over that sort
of thing.”</p>

<p>“Was she English?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a Devonshire girl. She broke it off in order
to marry a viscount; and three years after the marriage
they separated. Whose fault it was of course
I don’t know, but the girl was a selfish, self-centered
little thing, and I think her husband must have
been well rid of her.”</p>

<p>“Then you knew her?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I knew her.”</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>“She set her cap at me once, when she fancied,
and I believed, I was coming into a small fortune
from my father’s sister. But my father’s sister took
a dislike to me and when she died the money went
to some missionary society. Directly the girl heard
that, she found she no longer cared for me and
turned her attention to Johnson, with whom I was
living at the time, and who was already head over
ears in love with her.”</p>

<p>“That was out East, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Yes, in Hong Kong, which we have been talking
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>about so much to-night. I don’t think Johnson will
ever marry.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you? I do. In fact I am prepared to
wager he will be married within the year.”</p>

<p>Llanvar looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that!” he exclaimed. “Why,
who is the lady?”</p>

<p>Then it was that Hopford proceeded to tell him
about the pretty widow, as he called her, Cora Hartsilver,
and what he had noticed while in Jersey.
And they were both in Jersey still, he said, and, in
his opinion, likely to remain there some time.</p>

<p>“In fact, it would not surprise me at all,” he
ended, “if Johnson and Mrs. Hartsilver were to
become engaged before returning to England. Johnson
has not even hinted to me that the widow attracts
him, but I have noticed his expression when
he speaks of her, and, more than that, I have noticed
the way she looks at him when they are together.”</p>

<h4>SUNSET LOVE.<br>

<p>Perhaps one of the chief attractions of Jersey is
that even during July, August and September, when
most seaside resorts in England are so crowded
with excursionists that anything in the nature of
solitude is out of the question, you may find miles
of sea-beach where hardly a human being is in
sight. Add to this that the sun shines there usually
all day and every day in summer, that the blueness
of the sea resembles the Mediterranean, that
the landscapes over and seascapes around the whole
island are exceptionally beautiful, and that the inhabitants
are, for the most part, hospitable and
exceedingly polite, and the popularity of Jersey
is easily accounted for.</p>

<p>Johnson had meant to stay there only a week or
two, but more than a month had elapsed since his
arrival and he still tarried. Nor did he express any
intention of bringing his visit to a close. He had
told his newly-made friends in the Victoria Club
that he had now decided to remain “until the
weather broke;” but when some days later the
weather did break, he hesitated. The reason he gave
for altering his mind was that the air suited him.
Even if it had not suited him he would probably
have remained, however, seeing that he had fallen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>deeply in love with the beautiful young widow who
had come to him for advice, and that his love was
fully reciprocated.</p>

<p>It had all come about in a very curious way, yet
neither had as yet ventured to reveal to the other
the secret they both cherished. After three days’
heavy rain the weather recovered its normal condition—&#8203;blazing
sun and cloudless sky—&#8203;and then it
was that the doctor suggested to Cora Hartsilver
that he should drive her in his car right round the
coast.</p>

<p>The afternoon was gorgeously fine when they
set out from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Helier, and as they sped rapidly over
the picturesque coast-road which leads along Victoria
Avenue through Villees Nouaux to Bel Royal,
thence past Beaumont with its pretty red-roofed
houses nestling in the cliff behind the hamlet, then
by Le Haute Station and on towards the old-world
village of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aubin with streets so steep and narrow
that Johnson was forced to slow down to a
mile or two an hour, they began to feel that now at
last life seemed worth living.</p>

<p>“There is a lovely bay a little farther on,”
Johnson said as they crept up the steady slope
towards Mont Sohier. “I saw it from a boat the
other day, and have meant ever since to go there
by road. It is called <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Brelade’s Bay, and the
cliffs behind it are for the most part beautifully
wooded. I suggest we should stop there a little
while; I will leave the car at the hotel. Would
you like to do that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
They were almost the first words he had spoken
since they had set out, and for some moments his
companion did not answer. Then she said, and
her voice had a curious timbre, as though she were
holding herself in check:</p>

<p>“I will do whatever you like; the surroundings
here are so exquisite that no matter where we go
it will be pleasant. Look at that purple haze hanging
like a gauze curtain over the cliffs all round
the coast and right along the shore,” and she pointed.
“Did you ever see anything so perfect? And the
endless expanse of white sand with the sun’s rays
sparkling on it as far as eye can reach, and hardly
a soul in sight. I had no idea Jersey was so lovely;
had you, Doctor Johnson?”</p>

<p>He murmured some almost inaudible reply, and,
turning the corner sharply, slowly drew up at the
entrance to a garage flanked on both sides with
great bushes of hydrangeas.</p>

<p>“We will leave the car here,” he said, “and after
tea we can explore some of those woods on the
sloping cliffs. Probably from up there the view is
even finer.”</p>

<p>The hotel, though the holiday season was at its
height, they found almost deserted. The hordes of
trippers whose presence each had often suffered
from during August and September by the sea on
the coasts of England, were conspicuous by their
absence. The few visitors wandering on the beach
were of quite a different type. They were what can
most accurately be described as people of refinement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
During tea Johnson and his companion hardly
spoke. Some strange barrier seemed suddenly to
have risen up between them. Almost in silence they
afterwards strolled along the terrace, and a little
later turned their steps up a narrow, grass-grown
lane which appeared to lead in the direction of the
sloping woods they sought.</p>

<p>The lane curved, then turned abruptly to the
right. Presently it curved again, describing almost
a segment of a circle, then gradually became narrower.
The grass, too, was longer as they wandered
on. Then the branches of the trees on either side
began to meet overhead, and soon they found themselves
walking through a tunnel of thick foliage.</p>

<p>And still neither spoke. They walked very slowly
now. It was Johnson who at last broke the silence:</p>

<p>“Jersey will always be associated in my mind,”
he said in a low voice, “with some of the happiest
moments of my life—&#8203;this wonderful afternoon in
particular.”</p>

<p>“Why wonderful?” Cora asked almost in a whisper,
not trusting herself to look into his face.</p>

<p>“Why wonderful?”</p>

<p>Almost unconsciously his arm stole about her,
and he drew her, unresisting, closer to him.</p>

<p>“Why wonderful?” he repeated.</p>

<p>They were standing quite still now. His arms
encircled her. Her head sank forward on his breast
and she felt his face buried in her hair.</p>

<p>On an instant a wild wave of passionate love for
him swept over her. It was like the bursting of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>some great dam in her heart which for days past
she had controlled. Turning, she put her hands
behind his head and drew it down until his lips
were pressed to hers. For over a minute they remained
locked in a close embrace.</p>

<p>“Do you really mean it?” she exclaimed at last
in a feverish whisper, disengaging herself from his
strong arms. “You are not just flirting with me?
You are not doing this just to pass the time away,
or because this beautiful spot has intoxicated your
brain?”</p>

<p>She paused.</p>

<p>“Can all that is happening be really true,” she
exclaimed ardently. “Or is it only a beautiful dream
from which I shall presently awake?”</p>

<p>“It is no dream, my darling,” he murmured, taking
her face between his hands and gazing down
into her lovely eyes as though they mesmerized
him.</p>

<p>“I want you, my dear; I want you dreadfully;
you can have no idea how I yearn for you! Yes,
I ask you now if you will become my wife, for I
know you are the first woman I have ever truly
loved.”</p>

<p>He bent forward and kissed her again passionately
on the lips. As he did so he felt her body quiver.</p>

<p>He had meant to return to the hotel within an
hour or two, but more than three hours had passed
and still they did not go back. The sun was setting
now, and from where they sat the shadow of the
trees on a sheltered spot near the summit of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>wooded cliff, a magnificent view of the entire bay
unfolded itself beneath them.</p>

<p>But of that both were oblivious. They could see
nothing but each other’s eyes, hear nothing but
each other’s voices. The world might have fallen
in without their knowing.</p>

<p>The sun, which all day had blistered the scorched
earth, had sunk in a halo of gray and purple streaked
with seams of gold. Dusk was fading into darkness,
and still neither moved. Cora’s head rested in his
lap. His fingers, buried in her soft hair, toyed
gently with it. Again he bent down and kissed her
with all the ardor of his soul.</p>

<p>Night had set in when at last they rose to go.
Cora felt supremely happy. Her brief married life,
when she looked back on it, now seemed to her a
nightmare; her future married life, on the contrary
held all sorts of hopes. Would she have been as
happy with Sir Stephen Lethbridge—&#8203;the question
came unbidden into her thoughts—&#8203;as she felt she
would be with the man she had now accepted?</p>

<p>She dispelled the question unanswered, and at
once another took its place. The unsigned letter
she had received, the threat it contained, the
identity of the writer, what of all that? Her future
husband had not even referred to it again. Could
he have forgotten it in the ardor of his wooing?</p>

<p>As so often happens between people in close
sympathy, the thought, as it came to her, flashed
at once into his brain.</p>

<p>“I have been carefully considering,” he said suddenly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>“the matter you came to me about, and
that has led indirectly to our engagement. You
have nothing now to fear from that, my darling.
The scoundrel who sent the letter can do her worst.
Let her write to all your friends. Let her tell
them what she chooses. If she does, and they
talk in consequence, what can it matter to us?
It will not affect my love for you, or your love for
me, will it? And what else is there that matters?
In point of fact, when she reads or hears of our
engagement, as undoubtedly she soon will, she will,
I suspect, let the matter drop. Or she will write
to me, thinking I know nothing.”</p>

<p>“Then you still believe, dear, the writer to be a
woman?”</p>

<p>“I feel convinced it must be, though, as I told you,
she may have a male accomplice. But already I
have set in motion the machinery which I hope will
lead her unwittingly to reveal herself. We ought
to hear something in a week or two.”</p>

<p>They were now back at the hotel, and there they
dined. Cora was trembling with excitement at all
that had occurred. It all seemed so wonderful.
That she should, quite by chance, have read in the
newspaper of Doctor Johnson’s arrival; that the
unsigned letter should have come about that time;
that she should have thought of asking his advice;
that he should have interested himself in the matter;
that their friendship should have ripened so quickly
into love, and have ended as it had done!</p>

<p>Out in the night the moon was shining brightly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>It lit up the bay with a single streak of silver,
which extended far out across the sea to where the
lighthouses were winking along the coast. And
the atmosphere was as warm as in the tropics.</p>

<p>“Must we go back to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Helier now?” she inquired
in a strained voice, as they rose to go out.
“I feel to-night as if I could never sleep again.”</p>

<p>“And you need not sleep again,” he answered
with a smile, taking her hand in his, “at least until
you want to. We are returning to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Helier, but
not by the way we came. I said when we came out
we would go right round the island, but then I did
not know what was going to happen. We will
telephone to the friends with whom you are staying,
and you can speak to them. You can tell them
as little or as much as you like of what has befallen
you to-night. And you can say that you do not
expect to be home before midnight, or possibly even
later. It should be the most delightful drive either
of us has ever had.”</p>

<p>Slowly the car passed up the narrow lane which
led from the hotel. At the top it turned into a
wider road which branched off to the left.</p>

<p>The great headlight lit up the road for a hundred
yards or more. Increasing speed a little, Johnson
made straight for Corbière, where the road turned
abruptly to the right. Leaving La Pulente behind
them, they traveled rapidly until they reached the
village of La Thiebaut, not far from the northern
coast. And all the time they traveled they exchanged
hardly a word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
The moon had now completely risen, and as they
bore round to the right again to meet the road to
Ville Bagot, the car suddenly slowed down. It
stopped, and the engine became silent.</p>

<p>“Is anything the matter?” Cora inquired
anxiously.</p>

<p>No sound of any sort was audible save, in the far
distance, the sea washing up the beach.</p>

<p>“Nothing is the matter, my own darling,” Johnson
murmured passionately, “but I felt that on a night
like this—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>And so, in the solitude of that perfect night, they
renewed their vows once more. Locked in her lover’s
arms, Cora felt supremely happy. She felt his burning
kisses on her lips and face and neck, on her
eyes and on her hair.</p>

<p>“Darling,” she whispered back in an ecstacy at
last. “I never knew before that any one could be
so happy! Oh, how I hope you will never tire of
me, that we shall live in this state of bliss right
through to the end of our lives! I feel that until
now my life has been so aimless. I have led such
a butterfly existence. But it will be different in
the future, my darlingest—&#8203;oh, so completely different.
I mean to do all in my power to make
you the happiest man on earth, and then....”</p>

<p>Thus she talked, her words of love and passion
flowing like a torrent from her lips. For the time
all else but their great love was forgotten. Even
her fondness for Yootha had passed completely from
her mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
When Johnson had driven her back to the house
where she was still on a visit to her friends, and
had returned to the Brees Hotel, he found several
letters awaiting him which had arrived during the
day.</p>

<p>One, he saw, was from Preston, and bore the
Dieppe postmark. The other came from England,
and the handwriting was Blenkiron’s.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">


<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Twenty-seven">XXVII.</abbr>
</h3>
<h4>AGAINST THE WIND.
</h4>
</div>

<p>George Blenkiron wrote in his usual breezy style,
and much of the news in his letter interested Johnson
greatly, in view of what Hopford and Preston
had told him, also in view of his engagement to
Cora Hartsilver.</p>

<p>It was a long letter, and Blenkiron mentioned
among other items of news that, happening to be
in the neighborhood of Uckfield, some days before,
curiosity had prompted him to seek out Stapleton’s
cottage, The Nest, which he knew to be in the
vicinity.</p>

<p>“He calls it a ‘cottage,’” he wrote, “but in
reality it is a good-sized house, approached by a
carriage drive about half-a-mile long, and flanked
on three sides by woods with thick undergrowth.
The house itself lies in a hollow, and you come upon
it unexpectedly. My intention was only to have a
look at the place, but when I arrived at it so suddenly
I concluded that most likely somebody had
seen me approaching, so I went up and rang the
bell, meaning to inquire if Stapleton were at home.</p>

<p>“Though I rang three times, the only sound of
life within was the low growling of a dog; by the
‘woolliness’ of its growl I judged it to be a bulldog.
This rather stirred my curiosity, so I went round
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>to the back door, and there knocked. Again nobody
came; yet I distinctly heard a footstep just inside
the door. Finally, I tried to enter, but the door was
locked.</p>

<p>“By then my curiosity had become thoroughly
aroused, and I determined not to go away until I
had seen somebody. I therefore walked away from
the house by the road I had come, taking care not
to look behind me; then, when I could no longer
be seen from the house, I turned into the wood
and made my way back among the trees until I
reached a spot commanding a view of the front door
and carriage drive, but where I myself could not
be observed. The only thing I feared was that the
dog might presently be let out, when he would, I
felt sure, at once discover me.</p>

<p>“After about twenty minutes a smartly-dressed
young woman suddenly appeared. She came round
from the back of the house, and looked about her
as though expecting somebody. A few minutes
later I heard the iron gate across the drive open and
shut, and rather an old man came towards her.
They met in the middle of the drive, kissed most
affectionately, and then looked in my direction.
You can imagine my astonishment when I recognized
the man. It was Alix Stothert of the Metropolitan
Secret Agency!</p>

<p>“Neither of them saw me, of course; nor did they
suspect they were being watched. A minute later
they turned, and went towards the house. Arrived
at the front door, Stothert took a key out of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>pocket, unlocked the door and entered, followed by
the young woman. The door closed behind them,
and I heard it being locked again. I waited about
an hour longer to see if anything more would happen,
then I went back into the carriage drive,
walked boldly up to the house as if I had just arrived,
and rang loudly.</p>

<p>“It is an old house with an old-fashioned bell-pull.
Again there was no answer, or other sign of life;
even the dog did not growl, from which I concluded
it had been taken into some inner room. Four
times I rang, but the place might have been unoccupied
for all the notice that was taken. So then
I turned and came away. Strange, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>“Of course Stothert may have been there on
some ordinary matter of business; but then who
was the girl—&#8203;she was very dainty-looking—&#8203;and
why did nobody come when I rang? I can’t help
thinking something queer is going on there.</p>

<p>“As I was walking back to Uckfield, a man overtook
me, riding slowly on a push bike. About a
mile further on I overtook him; he appeared to be
repairing a tire. He glanced up at me casually as
I passed by, and the moment afterwards called out
to inquire if I had a match about me. I went back
and gave him one, for which he thanked me with
rather unnecessary profusion, I thought, and then
he offered me a cigarette, and lit it for me. We
exchanged a few words about the weather, and I
went on.</p>

<p>“At the railway station, two hours later, I saw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>him again. He was on the platform, waiting for
the train, but had no bicycle with him then. I
passed him twice, but he appeared not to recognize
me, so I did not speak to him. When I alighted at
Waterloo I happened to notice him behind me on
the platform, still without his bicycle; and when
I alighted from a taxi at Cox’s Hotel, in Jermyn
Street, where I am staying, to my astonishment he
was standing on the curb, about a hundred yards
along the street—&#8203;I could see only his profile, but
there could be no mistaking him as he stood there
staring up at a house on the opposite side of the
street. Then, for the first time, the thought struck
me that he must be shadowing me. I have not
seen him since, but I should recognize him at once
if I met him.”</p>

<p>In another part of the letter Blenkiron told
Johnson he had heard about Jessica’s success at
the tables at Dieppe, but he said nothing about
Yootha. He asked Johnson, however, if he had
happened to come across Harry Hopford, who he had
been told had gone to Jersey. If he should meet
him, he ended, would he remember to ask him to
write at once, as he wished to communicate with
him on a matter of importance.</p>

<p>Johnson refolded the letter, then opened the letter
from Preston.</p>

<p>Preston’s communication was brief. There was
no reference to his engagement, nor to Yootha. He
spoke of Jessica and her friends, however, and
again mentioned their having broken the bank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
“I am sick of this place,” he remarked towards
the end of the letter. “The town is crawling with
the most impossible people—&#8203;I can’t think who they
are or where they come from; holiday-makers, of
course. The chief attraction is naturally the Casino,
where these holiday folk swarm at night and seem
to delight in showing how foolishly they can squander
quite a lot of money. Our countrymen and women
show up badly in a place like this, and give the
French a poor opinion of the British race. I shall
probably return to London in a day or two, but my
movements will depend to some extent on circumstances.”</p>

<p>“On circumstances,” Johnson said aloud, as he
finished reading the letter. “Now, I wonder what
those circumstances are? It is not like Preston to
conceal his reasons. He is worried about something,
I am sure. The tone of his letter shows it,
and I can read between the lines.”</p>

<p>He appeared to ponder for a minute.</p>

<p>“Strange,” he said at last. “I was under the impression
that Yootha Hagerston was still in Dieppe,
and yet he makes no mention of her.”</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>“I wonder if they have quarrelled, or if—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>Suddenly his thoughts reverted to Cora; then
to the contents of Blenkiron’s letter; then to the
anonymous letter Cora had received, and finally
once more to Alix Stothert.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he said reflectively, “that girl
Stothert kissed so affectionately in the carriage drive
may have been his daughter, and yet—&#8203;—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
“And he said the dog that growled sounded like
a bulldog. La Planta has one, a brindle. I wish
the dog at Stapleton’s house had been let out to
pursue George, then he would have known its
color!”</p>

<p>He smiled at the thought.</p>

<p>“But, after all,” his train of thought ran on,
“why should La Planta’s dog have been in Stapleton’s
house? Plenty of people own bulldogs;
and for that matter it may not have been a bulldog.”</p>

<p>He had been singularly accurate in his conjecture
that Charlie Preston was worried. Indeed he was
more than worried. At the time of writing he had
felt almost in despair at the extraordinary change
that had suddenly come over Yootha. From the
night of her great success at the tables she had
become a slave to roulette. She played now with
Jessica during the afternoons as well as at night,
and not infrequently in the morning too. She
could talk and think of nothing but roulette and
<i lang="fr">petits chevaux</i>. At the moment her ambition was
to evolve a system by which she could never lose—&#8203;a
chimera pursued by many votaries of the game,
and invariably disastrous in the end.</p>

<p>Preston had made every endeavor to dissuade her
from continuing to play. He had assured her that
in the long run she must infallibly lose all she had
won, and more; but when day after day went by and
she almost always came out a winner in the end,
she felt she could afford to disregard his advice,
well-meant though she knew it to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
But the worst had happened when one day after
she had won a good deal and Preston had again
spoken to her, and had finished by trying for the
twentieth time to induce her to break her friendship
with Jessica, she had suddenly turned upon him,
practically told him to mind his own business, and
ended by saying that if she were going to break
any friendship it would be her friendship with him
and not with Jessica.</p>

<p>He had gone out that evening feeling miserable,
though instinctively knowing that in the end she
must come back to him. Yes, in the end, but how
long, he asked himself, would the end be in coming?
Jessica seemed to have hypnotized her, to be able
now to make her do her bidding in any way she
chose. Several times he had seen her and her two
undesirable friends and Yootha all seated together
round a table on the terrace of the hotel, smoking
cigarettes and drinking what looked like whisky
and soda in full view of everybody passing.</p>

<p>Again and again he had blamed himself for having
allowed her to adopt Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson as her
chaperone. Chaperone! Why, he said mentally,
a hundred times safer she would have been with no
chaperone than with that dissolute woman to look
after her, and her <i lang="fr">dévergondé</i> companions.</p>

<p>Two nights later, on returning to the hotel, he
was handed a note by the clerk in the office. Recognizing
Yootha’s handwriting on the envelope, he
took the note up to his bedroom to read it in private.
It was short, and ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Charlie</span>,—This is just to tell you that I am
leaving here to-morrow with Jessica and her friends. We
are going to Monte first, then probably we shall stay in
Paris a little while, and after that we shall return to
London, when I shall hope to see you. I don’t want to
quarrel with you, dear. Indeed I don’t, and I am dreadfully
sorry you should misjudge Jessica in the way you
do. She is such a good friend to me now, and I hope
we shall continue to be friends. But most of all I wish
you would overcome your prejudices against her, so that
we might all be friends together. I hate making you
unhappy, as I feel I am doing, but truly I think you are
unintentionally to blame. Lots of love, my dear.</p>

<p class="sigright">
“<span class="smcap">Yootha.</span>”
</p>
</div>

<p>“Curse the woman!” he exclaimed aloud, “and
the abominable way she has taught Yootha to
gamble. Well, I suppose I can do nothing at the
moment. I only hope to heaven that at Monte the
whole lot will lose heavily, so heavily that Yootha
at any rate will be brought to her senses once and
for all. Meanwhile I must try to hurry on our
wedding.”</p>

<p>Yootha went off early next day without seeing
him or even leaving a note to wish him good-by.
A week later he heard indirectly that at the tables
in Monte Carlo the four were still winning. A report
reached the Royal Hotel in Dieppe that they had
won a fabulous sum. It was quite extraordinary,
everybody said. Never within the memory of the
oldest <i lang="fr">habitués</i> of the Dieppe Casino had players
had such a run of luck. And its consistency was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>that they all played “anyhow,” or seemed to. On
the few occasions when they had experimented with
some system, they had lost heavily—&#8203;so it was said.</p>

<p>“Yootha, my darling,” Jessica remarked casually
to her one night towards the end of a champagne
supper at which all sorts of people were present,
for their luck had brought them a whole host of
“friends,” “what has become of your knight-errant—&#8203;or
is he your knight-errant no longer? I should
be delighted if I heard you had thrown him over,
or even that he had thrown you over. Have you
heard from him lately?”</p>

<p>“Not very lately,” Yootha replied quickly, with
a slight frown which Jessica did not fail to notice.
“He has gone back to London, I believe.”</p>

<p>“‘You believe.’ That doesn’t sound promising,
does it?” and she laughed in her deep voice, though
it was not a pleasant laugh. “When a man is
engaged to be married, especially to such a charming
girl—&#8203;a girl any man ought to be proud to speak to,
let alone be engaged to—&#8203;it isn’t very considerate
of him to leave her in the lurch in the way Captain
Preston left you. And if he neglects you now,
don’t you think he’s pretty sure to begin neglecting
you when you have been married a little while?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” Yootha answered awkwardly.
“Men are queer animals. I have always said so.
At one time I made up my mind never to marry.”</p>

<p>“But changed it directly you had the privilege
of meeting Captain Preston.”</p>

<p>She spoke almost with a sneer.</p>

<p>“Not directly,” the girl said weakly, conscious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>that, had she drunk less champagne and had all her
wits about her, she would have said something different,
would have stood up for her lover.</p>

<p>Jessica edged a little closer to her.</p>

<p>“Why not give him up?” she murmured so that
nobody but Yootha could hear. “He has not
treated you well; he has not played the game, has
he now? Just think—&#8203;he is supposed to be your
lover, yet after swearing, as I am sure he has done,
he has never in his life before met any woman to
approach you, he leaves you alone, lets you go
roaming about the Continent with two men and a
woman he intensely dislikes, and himself calmly
returns to England without even wishing you good-by!
Does that look like true love, dear? Does it
look like love at all? Supposing a man you knew
nothing about were going to marry some friend of
yours, what would you think, what would you say,
if all at once he treated her like this? Take my
advice, Yootha,” she went on, speaking lower still,
“give him up. Write to him to-morrow; come up
to my room and write to him at once; saying that
in view of all that has happened you have decided
to break off your engagement. He won’t break
his heart—&#8203;break his heart, I should think not!—and
believe me, you will one day thank me for having
saved you from marrying a man who doesn’t love
you.”</p>

<p>As she stopped speaking she refilled the girl’s
glass with champagne.</p>

<p>“And now listen to me,” she ended under her
breath. “I have something serious to say to you.”</p>

CHAPTER <abbr title="Twenty-eight">XXVIII.</abbr>
</h3>
<h4>NUMBER FIFTEEN.
</h4>
</div>

<p>When Yootha awoke next morning, her head was
aching badly. She had only a confused recollection
of the events of the previous night, and the more
she tried to remember exactly what had happened,
the greater the tangle became.</p>

<p>Her blinds were down and the room was still
almost in darkness, as she had not yet been called.
For about an hour she remained in a sort of disturbed
half-sleep; then gradually she began to wonder
what the time could be. Through the open windows
the sound of traffic came to her, which made her
think it must be late. She turned to look at her
watch. It had stopped at four in the morning.</p>

<p>She felt under her pillow for the electric bell
push, and some minutes later one of the hotel maids
entered.</p>

<p>“What time is it?” Yootha asked.</p>

<p>“Close on one o’clock, miss.”</p>

<p>“One o’clock! But why was I not called? Why
was my cup of tea not brought?”</p>

<p>“I will inquire, miss,” and the maid left the
room, closing the door behind her.</p>

<p>Soon she returned. She said that before Mrs.
Mervyn-Robertson had left she had said that Miss
Hagerston was very tired and must not be disturbed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
“How do you mean, before she left?” Yootha
inquired. “Where has she gone?”</p>

<p>“I have no idea, miss. She left the hotel this
morning with her maid, and the two gentlemen who
were with her have gone too.”</p>

<p>“You mean gone away? Gone, with their luggage?”</p>

<p>“Yes, miss.”</p>

<p>Yootha started up in bed.</p>

<p>“But this is extraordinary!” she exclaimed.
“They never said a word yesterday about leaving.
Has no message been left for me?”</p>

<p>“No, miss. I made that inquiry.”</p>

<p>A whole flood of thoughts, doubts, suspicions,
surged through the girl’s brain. Oh, if only she
could remember exactly what had happened on the
previous night! But the harder she tried to concentrate
her thoughts, the more impossible she found
it to remember anything. She could recollect playing
and winning in the Casino during the afternoon
and evening; after that her mind was a blank.
She could not recollect even where she had had
supper, or with whom, or if she had had supper
at all!</p>

<p>Then, all at once, her heart seemed to stop beating.
Ever since the night she and Jessica and her
friends had together broken the bank at Dieppe,
Jessica had been acting as her banker. That is to
say she had suggested that in order to save Yootha
trouble—&#8203;so she put it—&#8203;she would advance her
money to play with, as much as she might want,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>and, in return, take charge of the girl’s winnings.
Every morning she had come to Yootha and told
her the exact sum she held belonging to her, and
out of it she had handed Yootha whatever sum
she asked for. But there had been no record or
acknowledgment, or aught else in writing. Yootha
had placed implicit confidence in her friend and
now—&#8203;—</p>

<p>She saw it all, and her mouth went suddenly dry.
Jessica had left her, taking with her the whole of
the very considerable sum she, Yootha, had won
during the past weeks. Had she not been so lucky,
Jessica and her friends would no doubt have left
her long before. Now, probably, they had come
to the conclusion enough money had been won by
her to make it worth their while to decamp with it.
And what could she do? If she tried to claim it
Jessica would, of course, say she knew nothing
whatever about it, and perhaps declare her to be
suffering from a delusion.</p>

<p>Breakfast was brought to her room, but she could
not touch it. Then suddenly a feeling of terrible
loneliness came over her. She realized she was alone
in Monte Carlo, where she knew nobody but people
to whom Jessica had introduced her, and whom she
had no wish to meet again. True, she had money
enough to pay her fare home, but had she enough
to pay the bill at this very expensive hotel where
she had been staying already a fortnight? To offer
the manager a cheque might, she felt, lead to unpleasantness
should he refuse to accept it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
She dressed as quickly as she could, and went
out into the town. The sun was shining brightly,
and the band playing, and crowds of well-dressed
men and women seemed to be everywhere. She
was conscious, as she wandered aimlessly through
the beautiful gardens of the Casino, of attracting
attention and admiration.</p>

<p>Presently her gaze rested on the entrance to the
Casino. A stream of people was passing in and out.
The band was playing a jazz which she loved, and
the music stirred her pulse. For the moment the
thought of her distress rested less heavily on her
mind. And then, all at once, the gambling fever,
which had temporarily subsided, began to reassert
itself. Play would be in full swing now, she reflected.
She pictured the crowd grouped around the
roulette. She heard the croupier’s bored voice droning
“<i lang="fr">Faites vos jeux</i>,” and “<i lang="fr">Rien n’va plus</i>,” and the
rattle of the little ball as it spun merrily round in the
revolving well. Then she saw the numbers slowing
down, saw them stop, and heard the croupier calling:
“<i lang="fr">Le numéro quinze!</i>”</p>

<p>She opened her vanity bag, pulled out the money
it contained, and proceeded to count it carefully.
It was all the ready money she possessed. Certainly
it did not amount to enough to settle her hotel bill
for the past fortnight, and the bill was bound to be
presented soon. She had come to look upon winning
at the tables as a matter of daily routine. Also, she
yearned to play again. The Casino with its heated
atmosphere, its scented women, its piles of notes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>and its chink of gold, seemed to be calling to her,
beckoning her to come and fill her depleted coffers
at its generous fount of wealth, especially now that
she needed money. For a brief moment she thought
of Preston, and of their last meeting, and of his
earnest warning. Then, dispelling the disagreeable
reflection, she stuffed her money back into her bag,
shut it with a snap, rose, and walked quickly in the
direction of the famous Temple of Mammon.</p>

<p>She had little difficulty in securing a seat. For
a minute or two she watched the play. Then she
backed the number she had thought of while in the
gardens—&#8203;<i lang="fr">le numéro quinze</i>.</p>

<p>It came up.</p>

<p>She backed it again, and once more swept in her
winnings. Then she started playing <i lang="fr">en plein</i>, recklessly
and with big stakes, as she had been in the
habit of doing. But her luck had suddenly changed.
Again and again she lost. She doubled, and trebled,
and quadrupled her stakes.</p>

<p>But still she lost.</p>

<p>In less than half an hour she had only a single
louis left, and, rising abruptly, she walked out of
the <i lang="fr">salon</i> like a woman in a dream.</p>

<p>A louis! Of what use was that? She went back
to her hotel, and locked herself in her room. Her
brain felt on fire. She thought she was going mad.
She wanted to cry, but could not.</p>

<p>For an hour she lay on her bed, suffering mental
agony. Then with an effort she got up, and sent
off a telegram.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Twenty-nine">XXIX.</abbr>
</h3>
<h4>A MESSAGE FROM YOOTHA.<br>
</h4>
</div>

<p>It was seven in the morning when Preston was
awakened by his servant, Tom, and handed a telegram
which had just arrived.</p>

<p>Before he opened it he guessed it must be from
Yootha. It ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“I am in great trouble. Can you possibly come to me?
I am alone here and ill in bed. Jessica and the others
have left Monte Carlo. Do please telegraph a reply as
soon as this reaches you.”</p>
</div>

<p>Preston was not a man to deliberate. He always
made up his mind at once, and acted without hesitation.</p>

<p>“Is the messenger waiting?” he asked Tom, who
still stood at his bedside.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then give me a foreign telegram form.”</p>

<p>Swiftly he scribbled the answer.</p>

<p>“Give that to the boy,” he said, “and sixpence
for himself, and tell him to get back to the post
office as quickly as he can. Then come back to me.”</p>

<p>In a moment the man returned.</p>

<p>“Pack my suit-case, Tom. I am going to Monte
Carlo at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
“For how long, sir?”</p>

<p>“Pack enough for a fortnight.”</p>

<p>He traveled through to the Riviera without
stopping in Paris, and drove direct to the Hotel X.
Upon inquiring for Yootha he was told that the
doctor was with her. The hotel manager looked
grave when Preston inquired how ill she had been.</p>

<p>A moment later the door opened, and a solemn-faced
gentleman of patriarchal aspect entered. The
manager at once introduced him to Preston, and
explained who Preston was.</p>

<p>“She has dropped off to sleep at last,” the doctor
said. “I had to give her a mild narcotic. She has
been eagerly awaiting your arrival since she received
your wire, and I believe your presence will do her
more good than anything else. She appears to be
suffering chiefly from shock—&#8203;a mental shock of some
sort. Her nerves are greatly upset.”</p>

<p>When some hours later Yootha awoke, her gaze
rested upon her lover seated beside her bed. For
a moment she fancied she must still be dreaming.
Then, with a glad cry, she sat up and stretched her
arms out to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, my darling,” she cried, “how good of you
to have come to me! Even when I got your telegram
I feared that something might detain you. I
have had a terrible time since last we met—&#8203;terrible!”</p>

<p>For a minute they remained locked in each other’s
arms, the happiest moments they had spent since
that never-to-be-forgotten evening under the shadow
of the Sugarloaf Mountain in Monmouthshire. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>then, perhaps for the first time, Yootha realized to
the full the joy of being truly loved by a man on
whose loyalty and steadfastness she knew she could
implicitly depend.</p>

<p>Yootha’s recovery was rapid, and in the following
week Preston decided to take her to Paris, which
she was anxious to visit, never having been there.</p>

<p>“You had better telegraph to your aunt and ask
if she can meet us there, as you say she is well
again,” he said. “It wouldn’t do for us to stay
there alone, as long as conventions have to be considered,”
and he smiled cynically. “Which reminds
me that Harry Hopford is in Paris—&#8203;I had a letter
from him yesterday. I am sure he will be glad
to see you.”</p>

<p>And so, some days later, they arrived at the
Hôtel Bristol, where they found Yootha’s aunt
awaiting them. She was a pleasant, middle-aged
woman with intelligent eyes and a sense of humor,
and she greeted them effusively.</p>

<p>“You don’t hesitate to make use of me when I
am in health,” she said laughingly to her niece.
“I had not the least wish to come to Paris, but now I
am very glad I have come. Yes, I am well again,
but I don’t think you look as if Monte Carlo and its
excitement had agreed with you. By the way, a
delightful young man called here yesterday to ask
if you had arrived. He was so pleasant to talk to
that I persuaded him to stay to lunch. He seemed
to think a lot of you. His name is Hopford.”</p>

<p>“Harry Hopford! A capital lad. I am glad you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>met him. He served under me in France and was
quite a good soldier.”</p>

<p>“He told me he had served under you. He wants
you to meet him at an address in Clichy at nine
to-morrow night. I have the address somewhere.”</p>

<p>“A bit of luck for me, your coming to Paris,”
Hopford said when they met on the following night.
“I particularly wanted to see you, Preston. My
inquiries and those of these friends of mine,” he had
just introduced to Preston the two Paris detectives,
his friend on <cite>Le Matin</cite>, and Johnson’s friend Idris
Llanvar, “have succeeded in making some astonishing
discoveries concerning Jessica and her friends,
and now I am on the way to tracking Alix Stothert
to his lair.”</p>

<p>“Alix Stothert!” Preston exclaimed. “What has
he to do with it?”</p>

<p>“A good deal, apparently. To begin with, he
appears to be a friend of Stapleton’s, for a friend of
mine in London has, at my request, been watching
Stapleton’s house near Uckfield, called The Nest.
Stothert goes there frequently, it seems; my friend
believes he calls there for letters. And the other
day some fellow arrived there, knocked and rang,
and then, getting no answer, went and hid in the
undergrowth in the wood close by, and remained
watching the house. While he was watching,
Stothert arrived and was met by a girl who, my
friend says, is employed by Stothert secretly, and
the two went into the house. When the fellow who
had lain concealed in the wood—&#8203;and been himself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>watched by my friend—&#8203;went back to Uckfield, my
friend followed him on a bicycle, and finally
shadowed him back to London and to an hotel—&#8203;Cox’s
in Jermyn Street. But, though afterwards he
made inquiries at the hotel, he was unable to find
out who the fellow was.”</p>

<p>“George Blenkiron, when in town, generally stays
at Cox’s,” Preston said reflectively.</p>

<p>“Does he? Then he may know who the man is,
and his name. I’ll write to him to-morrow. It is
such a small hotel.”</p>

<p>Hopford had also a good deal to say about Mrs.
Timothy Macmahon and her intimacy with the late
Lord Froissart; about Marietta Stringborg and her
husband; about Fobart Robertson, whose whereabouts,
he said, he was likely soon to discover;
and about Alphonse Michaud, proprietor of the
Metropolitan Secret Agency at the house with the
bronze face. One important fact he had already
established—&#8203;Michaud was intimately acquainted
with Jessica and Stapleton. Yet at the Royal
Hotel in Dieppe, Preston had told him, Jessica,
Stapleton and La Planta had openly stated that they
knew Michaud only by name.</p>

<p>“Which confirms the suspicion I have for some
time entertained,” Hopford went on, “that Jessica
and her friends are in some way associated with the
house with the bronze face.”</p>

<p>“There I can’t agree with you,” Preston said. “In
view of all that has happened, such a thing seems
to me incredible. Why, we used to consult the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>Secret Agency concerning Jessica and her past history,
don’t you remember? And they found out
for us several things about her.”</p>

<p>“Several things, yes, but not one of the things
they ‘found out’ was of importance. It is the
Agency’s business, to my belief, to hunt with the
hounds and run with the hare, and they do it
successfully. Surely you recollect Mrs. Hartsilver’s
telling us how she and Miss Hagerston had been
shown by Stothert what he declared to be the actual
pearl necklace belonging to Marietta Stringborg,
and saying the necklace stolen from her at the Albert
Hall ball and afterwards found in Miss Hagerston’s
possession, was made of imitation pearls? Well, I
can prove that on that occasion, as well as at other
times, Stothert intentionally lied.”</p>

<p>“Then what is your theory?”</p>

<p>“That in some way, yet to be discovered, Jessica
and her gang—&#8203;for they are a gang—&#8203;and the Metropolitan
Secret Agency, are playing each other’s game
and have played it for a long time. Incidentally
I have found out, too, that La Planta once represented
an insurance company in Amsterdam, of
which Lord Froissart was chairman or director, and
that—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>“Forgive my interrupting you, Hopford,” Preston
cut in, “but what you say reminds me that I too
was told, by a Major Guysburg I met in Dieppe.
He is a man you ought to meet; he was leaving for
America when we parted, but ought soon to be back,
and he promised to look me up in town on his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>return. And he can tell you a lot about Alphonse
Michaud, who, he assured me, at one time ran a
most disreputable haunt in Amsterdam.”</p>

<p>Hopford produced his notebook.</p>

<p>“How do you spell the major’s name?” he asked
quickly, and Preston told him.</p>

<p>“And where does he stay when in town?”</p>

<p>“At Morley’s Hotel, I believe,” and Hopford
wrote that down too.</p>

<p>“Now for heaven’s sake don’t say ‘how small the
world is,’ Preston,” Hopford observed lightly as he
replaced his notebook in his pocket, “because that
is a platitude which makes me see red. I must see
Guysburg directly he arrives in London. Certainly
we are getting on. I suppose Guysburg didn’t speak
about a diamond robbery in Amsterdam from a
merchant living in the Kalverstraat, which took place
some years ago? The thief was never caught.”</p>

<p>Preston laughed.</p>

<p>“The very thing he did tell me,” he answered.
“The stones had been insured by Michaud, to whom
the insurance money was paid under protest because
the idea had got about that Michaud himself,
or some person employed by him, had stolen them.”</p>

<p>Hopford turned to the French woman-detective,
and raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“You hear that?” he said to her in French. “Isn’t
it strange how small—&#8203;no, I won’t say it!
Mademoiselle was employed,” he addressed Preston
again, “on that very case in Amsterdam, and feels
as convinced to-day as she did then that Michaud,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>aided by La Planta, spirited away the stones. Yet
nothing could be proved. There were not even
sufficient clues to justify the arrest of either of the
two men. By the way, I am trying to get mademoiselle
to return to London with me, and she hopes
she will be able to. Also I have forgotten to tell
you that Idris Llanvar is a famous mental specialist
practicing here in Paris—&#8203;isn’t that so, Llanvar?
Years ago he was Johnson’s <i lang="la">locum tenens</i> in Shanghai,
when Johnson practiced in Hong Kong. It was
Johnson who kindly gave me an introduction to
him, when he and I met in Jersey. Aren’t you glad,
Preston, that Johnson is going to marry Mrs. Hartsilver?
I think she is such a charming woman,
though I don’t know her very well. But I met the
late Henry Hartsilver once or twice—&#8203;a typical
profiteer, and, I thought, a most offensive person.
She was well rid of him. Did you know Sir Stephen
Lethbridge?”</p>

<p>Preston looked at Hopford oddly.</p>

<p>“What makes you suddenly ask that?” he said.
“What was your train of thought?”</p>

<p>“I had no train of thought, so far as I am aware,”
Hopford replied. “But there is a vague rumor
in London that someone, a woman, a friend of
Stothert’s, holds certain letters written by Mrs. Hartsilver
to Sir Stephen Lethbridge, or by Sir Stephen
to her, and that this woman is trying to sell them
to Mrs. Hartsilver. Incidentally, Preston, your
name has been whispered in relation to the affair,
which leads me to suspect that Mistress Jessica may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>not be wholly unassociated with this latest attempt
at blackmail. Llanvar had a letter from Johnson
yesterday, who is still in Jersey, and in it he
alluded to the rumor, but in very guarded language.”</p>

<p>Preston did not answer. His lips were tightly
closed. Then, as if to distract attention from what
Hopford had just said, he produced his cigar case
and passed it round.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Yootha was very anxious to see, as she put it,
“everything in Paris worth seeing,” from the Bastille
to the Ambassadeurs and the Cascade, and from
the Louvre to the Palais de Versailles, so during the
next few days Preston devoted himself to her entirely.
The art galleries in particular appealed to
her, also the Quartier Latin with its queer little
streets of cobble stones and its stuffy but picturesque
old-world houses of which she had so often heard.
Exhibitions like the Grand Guignol and the Café de
la Mort, on the other hand, she detested.</p>

<p>Hopford and Llanvar had dined with them once,
and afterwards Hopford’s friend on <cite>Le Matin</cite> had
piloted them all to various interesting night-haunts
of which English folk visiting Paris for the most
part know nothing. He had also taken them into
curious caverns below the Rue de la Harpe and
streets in its vicinity, and shown them the houses
there propped up from below with enormous wooden
beams where the arches built over those old quarries
have given way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
“But how come there to be quarries here at all?”
Yootha had asked in surprise.</p>

<p>The representative of <cite>Le Matin</cite> had evidently
expected the question, for at once he had entered
into a long explanation about how, when Paris was
first built, stones for building purposes had been
quarried out in the immediate neighborhood; how
the City had gradually reached the edge of those
quarries, and how, in order to be able to continue
to extend the City, it had been necessary to arch the
quarries over and then erect buildings on the arches
themselves.</p>

<p>“Of course the good folk who live in those houses
above our heads,” he laughed as he pointed upward,
“have no idea that their houses are propped up
from below, and some day they may get the surprise
of their lives by finding themselves and their houses
suddenly swallowed up in the bowels of the earth.”</p>

<p>It was late when finally they had all separated.
Then Hopford, on arriving at Rue des Petits
Champs, had found a blue telegram awaiting him.
It came from his chief, who said Hopford must
return at once.</p>

<p>“I have most important news for you,” the message
had ended.</p>

<h4>BLENKIRON’S NARRATIVE.
</h4>
</div>

<p>London was now almost full again, after its two
months of social stagnation, for October was close
at hand. Already announcements were appearing
in the newspapers of balls and dances, receptions and
dinner parties, and other forms of entertainment
with which people with money to spend and no
work to do endeavor to kill time. And among the
social receptions largely “featured” was one to be
given by Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson at her house in
Cavendish Place in the third week in October.</p>

<p>Johnson and Mrs. Hartsilver were back in town,
so were Captain Preston and Yootha Hagerston,
and George Blenkiron was staying at Cox’s Hotel,
but none of the five had been invited to Jessica’s
reception. The leading London newspapers had been
asked to send representatives, however, and at his
request Harry Hopford had been detailed by his
chief to attend.</p>

<p>Among the visitors at Morley’s Hotel, in Trafalgar
Square, was a dark man, obviously a foreigner, with
black, rather oily hair and a carefully waxed
moustache, a florid complexion and a tendency to
obesity. Hopford noticed his name in the visitors’
book when he went to inquire for Major Guysburg
who, Preston had told him, had just arrived there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>from America. The foreigner’s name was Alphonse
Michaud.</p>

<p>“Major Guysburg is dining out,” Hopford was
told.</p>

<p>He lit a cigarette, paused in the hall for a moment,
then decided to look up Blenkiron, whom he had
not seen since his return to town, but who was
staying at Cox’s Hotel in Jermyn Street. On his
way he called at a flat in Ryder Street, and found
a friend of his at home and hard at work writing.
It was the friend who had, at his request, watched
Stapleton’s “cottage,” The Nest, near Uckfield,
while he, Hopford, had been in Paris.</p>

<p>“I am on my way to see a friend at Cox’s Hotel,”
Hopford said, when the two had conversed for some
moments, “quite a good fellow, name of Blenkiron.
Would you care to come along? You might run
across the person you shadowed from The Nest to
Cox’s that day, you never know.”</p>

<p>Blenkiron was in, Hopford was told, and a messenger
took his card. A few minutes afterwards he
was asked “please to come up.”</p>

<p>“’Evening, Blenkiron,” he said, as he was shown
in. “Hope I am not disturbing you, eh? Tell me
if I am, and I’ll go away. I have brought a friend
I should like to introduce,” and he stepped aside to
let his friend advance.</p>

<p>Silence followed. In evident astonishment Hopford’s
friend and Blenkiron stared at each other.</p>

<p>“Haven’t we met before?” the latter said at last.
“Surely on the road from The Nest to Uckfield—&#8203;—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
The other smiled.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied. “And I followed you back
to town, and to this hotel. Afterwards I tried to
find out your name, and who you were, but failed.
I hope you will forgive me, Mr. Blenkiron; but I
should like you to know I followed you at Hopford’s
request.”</p>

<p>The three burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“So you, Blenkiron,” Hopford exclaimed, “are
the rascal whose identity has so puzzled us! Really,
this is amusing.”</p>

<p>Whisky was produced, and soon all three were on
the best of terms.</p>

<p>“Have you heard the latest about the house with
the bronze face?” Blenkiron asked presently.</p>

<p>“No, what?” Hopford answered eagerly.</p>

<p>“Alix Stothert, Camille Lenoir, and a girl of quite
good family, and well-known in Society—&#8203;I am not
at liberty to tell you her name—&#8203;and several others
were arrested there about six o’clock this evening
for being accomplices in attempted blackmail. In
connection with the blackmail charge any number
of people we know are likely to be involved. The
names of three you will, I expect, guess at once.”</p>

<p>“J. and Co.”</p>

<p>Blenkiron nodded.</p>

<p>“By Jove, how splendid!” Hopford exclaimed.
“Who told you all this, George?”</p>

<p>“The Commissioner of Police himself, so the information
is accurate enough.”</p>

<p>Hopford sprang to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
“May I use your telephone?” he asked, as he
walked quickly towards the door. “Come and stand
by me and I’ll dictate the whole story through right
away!”</p>

<p>“Hopford, sit down!” Blenkiron shouted imperatively,
pointing to the chair from which the lad had
just risen. “Not a word of what I have told you
is to appear in the press until I authorize it. Not
a word! Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“But the other papers will get it,” Hopford exclaimed,
with his hand on the door handle.</p>

<p>“They won’t. That I promise you. The Commissioner
of Police, an intimate friend of mine, told
me while I was dining with him to-night that the
whole affair is to be kept out of the papers until the
entire gang has been arrested. If you print a line
now you will defeat the ends of justice by warning
the unarrested accomplices, and so, probably, enabling
them to escape. I mean what I say, Hopford.
Preston, Miss Hagerston, Johnson and Mrs. Hartsilver
will be here soon—&#8203;I telephoned asking them
to come as I had, I said, something important to
tell them. There will be supper, so you and your
friend had better stay.”</p>

<p>Hopford reflected.</p>

<p>“Have you room for yet one more at supper?”
he asked suddenly. “Major Guysburg, a friend of
Preston’s, is at Morley’s—&#8203;just come from America.
He knows a lot about a man, Alphonse Michaud,
who is the mainspring of the Metropolitan Secret
Agency, and is also at Morley’s. I have not yet
met Guysburg, but Preston has explained to him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>who I am, and the major is greatly interested in
the movements of J.’s gang. He should, in fact, be
able to throw further light on some of the curious
happenings of the last two years.”</p>

<p>“Then by all means ring him up and ask him to
come along,” Blenkiron answered. “But you are
mistaken about Michaud’s being at Morley’s, Hopford,
because he was one of those arrested this evening
at the house with the bronze face.”</p>

<p>“Michaud arrested? Good again! But what was
he arrested for?”</p>

<p>“Attempted blackmail—&#8203;same as the others. But
in Michaud’s case there is a second charge. Michaud,
the Commissioner tells me, turns out to be a regular
importer, on a big scale, of a remarkable drug
you have already heard about, which is made and
only procurable in Shanghai, Canton, and Hankau.
The secret of this drug belongs to one man—&#8203;a Chinaman.</p>

<p>“Now, sixteen years ago Michaud served a sentence
of five years’ imprisonment in a French penitentiary
for attempted blackmail; became, on his
release, a greater scoundrel than ever, and finally
succeeded in becoming naturalized as an Englishman.
Then he went out to the East, set up in business
in Canton, and eventually scraped acquaintance
with a Shanghai wine merchant named Julius Stringborg,
who introduced him to Fobart Robertson,
Timothy Macmahon, Levi Schomberg, Alix Stothert,
Stapleton, and several others, including, of course,
Angela Robertson.</p>

<p>“Months passed, and then one day Michaud
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>turned up in London again. None suspected, however,
that he was now engaged in secretly importing
the strange drug, for which he soon found a ready
sale at a colossal profit. Some of the properties of
the drug you already know, but it has other properties.
Then, after a while he started systematically
blackmailing many of his clients, for to be in possession
of the drug, without authority, is in England a
criminal offense. Not content with that, however,
he now decided, in order to be able to extend his
operations, to take into his confidence one or two
of his friends. Among those friends were Marietta
Stringborg and her husband, Angela Robertson and
Timothy Macmahon. Those four formed the nucleus
of a little gang of criminals which has since increased
until—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>The arrival of Preston and Yootha Hagerston,
followed almost immediately by Johnson and Cora
Hartsilver, put an end to Blenkiron’s narrative. All
were now greatly excited, and eager for information
concerning the house with the bronze face and what
had happened there; so that when Major Guysburg
was announced he found himself ushered into a
room where everybody seemed to be talking at once.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER <abbr title="Thirty-one">XXXI.</abbr>
</h3>
<h4>CONCLUSION.
</h4>
</div>

<p>The two-column article which appeared in only one
London morning newspaper created a profound sensation.
Quoted in part in the evening newspapers
throughout the country, it became the principal topic
of conversation in the clubs and in the streets, but
in particular in social circles over the whole of the
United Kingdom.</p>

<p>That the most important secret information
agency in London, an organization which had come
to be looked upon as the most enterprising and trustworthy
there had ever been in the Metropolis, and
which half the peerage, to say nothing of the ordinary
aristocracy, had at one time and another
consulted in confidence, should suddenly be discovered
to be nothing more than the headquarters of
a nest of rogues and blackmailers, dealt Society a
terrible blow.</p>

<p>The blow was all the harder because clients of
the so-called Metropolitan Secret Agency knew they
had poured into the ears of the benevolent-looking
old man who called himself Alix Stothert, secrets
about themselves, their relatives, and their friends,
which they would not for untold gold have related
had they dreamed such secrets might ever be revealed.
And now, to their horror, it seemed that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>at least a dozen well-known Society people, or rather
people well-known in Society and believed to be the
“soul of honor,” were, and had been all the time,
active members of the “Agency Gang,” as it was
now termed, prominent among them being Mrs.
Mervyn-Robertson, Aloysius Stapleton, handsome
young Archie La Planta, and the rich retired tradesman
and his wife, Julius and Marietta Stringborg,
to name only a few.</p>

<p>No wonder the Metropolitan Secret Agency had
always known so much about the intimate affairs of
everybody in London who “mattered,” and about
the secret concerns of rich county folk throughout
the country! The knowledge possessed by the notorious
Bertha Trost of Clifford Street, who during
the war had been quietly pushed out of the country
as an “undesirable alien” had been insignificant by
comparison, people said. And the Agency’s “methods
of procedure” had been extremely simple. One of
their plans had consisted in worming out of useful
clients as much private information as possible of
a compromising nature, not only about themselves,
but about their acquaintances and friends, piecing
it all together, and then, at a later date, instructing
some accomplice to approach or write anonymously
to the prospective victims, threatening them with
public exposure if they refused to pay heavily for
secrecy. And so cleverly was this always done that
the Agency invariably safeguarded itself against risk
of discovery.</p>

<p>Another method of procedure, equally effective,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>consisted in selling secretly, at an enormous profit,
the strange Chinese drug smuggled into the country
by Alphonse Michaud, and accomplices would then
threaten with exposure persons having it in their
possession.</p>

<p>In addition to this, Michaud and other members
of the Agency Gang would administer the drug in a
particular way themselves, so that it deadened their
victims’ memory from a time prior to the period of
unconsciousness which it produced. It was, the
newspaper article declared, a most extraordinary
compound, and, being colorless and devoid of all
smell, could be administered without arousing the
least suspicion of its presence. For which reasons,
no doubt, some members of the gang had gone so
for as to dope other members with it, when they saw
that by doing so they could themselves benefit.</p>

<p>That had happened, it seemed, on the occasion
when Archie La Planta had been called out of the
box at the Alhambra whilst attending a performance
of the Russian Ballet. On that night he had met
a friend in the foyer, a member of the gang, who had
suggested his joining him in a drink in his rooms,
which were close by, in Charing Cross Road. La
Planta, of course, all unsuspecting, had walked across
to his friend’s rooms, yet when he had recovered
consciousness in his own chambers in Albany, all
recollection of his having gone to those rooms in
Charing Cross Road and afterwards being conducted
back to his own chambers by his “friend,” had completely
faded from his memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
And the reason he had been doped that night and
in that way—&#8203;this the man who had doped him confessed
afterwards under cross-examination—&#8203;had
been to keep him away from Mrs. Mervyn-Robertson’s
supper party, a few hours later at her own
house, where the same ruse had been employed by
the same man, with a woman accomplice, who unseen
had then taken from her the key of her safe,
which they had then rifled, taking not only the valuables
it contained, but inadvertently a packet of
letters which proved to be the letters Cora Hartsilver
had written to Sir Stephen Lethbridge, and
those he had written to her. These documents
Jessica had obtained some time before, by bribery,
from servants dismissed by Cora and by Sir Stephen
for inefficiency, and she had been holding them with
a view to using them some day as levers to extort
money from Cora; but the woman who had stolen
them from the safe had taken that step herself and
sent Cora the anonymous letter which had reached
her when in Jersey.</p>

<p>And all through it was the same. To right and left
clients of the house with the bronze face and intimate
friends of Jessica, of Stapleton, of La Planta’s,
of Mrs. Stringborg and her husband, and of other
members of the Agency Gang, had been secretly
pilloried and made to pay, while from time to time
members of the gang had themselves been victimized
by one or other of their own traitorous accomplices,
generally through the medium of the Chinese drug.
Levi Schomberg, though not a member, had by accident
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>been made aware of the existence of the gang,
its ramifications and its methods, a client to whom
he had once advanced a considerable sum having
promised to reveal what he called “the whole organization
of an extraordinary secret society of criminals
operating in this country and on the Continent”
if Levi would cancel a portion of the debt. This the
moneylender had, after some demur, agreed to do,
with the result that afterwards he had been himself
able to extort money from Jessica and Stapleton,
and other members, under threats of exposure, in
precisely the same way that they levied blackmail
on their victims.</p>

<p>“And La Planta,” Hopford said, as he and others
were talking the case over in the reporters’ room
some time after his article had appeared. “La Planta
admits that he drugged Levi Schomberg in the box
at the Albert Hall on the night of the ball, though
he swears it was not his intention to poison him.
Either he mistook the dose he administered in the
whisky and soda, he says, or else Levi must have had
a weak heart—&#8203;Doctor Johnson will probably have
something to say about that. La Planta declares,
too, that he gave the drug on the advice of Stapleton,
who handed him the actual dose, saying it was
the right amount. Whether it was or not, I suppose
we shall never know, though Stapleton has yet to
be cross-examined. And another thing we shall
probably never know is why Levi Schomberg disliked
Mrs. Hartsilver so intensely. He never missed
an opportunity of maligning her when her back was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>turned. Can he at one time or another have tried
to extort money from her, and failed? Or have
tried to make love to her, and been turned down?
Or can he have had some reason for fearing
her?”</p>

<p>“Talking of that, Hopford,” his colleague said,
after a pause, “do you remember the night you stood
up so stoutly for Mrs. Hartsilver, the night I told
you that you must be biased in her favor because
you knew her socially? What, after all, was the
truth about those rumors concerning her and concerning
Captain Preston? Did you ever find out?
I tried to, but I heard nothing more.”</p>

<p>“Why,” Hopford answered, “that was more of
the Agency Gang’s dirty work. They invented a
scandalous story, which they put up to Preston when
he was in his house-boat during Henley week. The
story would take too long to tell—&#8203;George Blenkiron
got it at first hand from the Commissioner of Police,
and retailed it to me practically word for word. The
upshot was that Preston would have either to abet—&#8203;assisted
by Miss Hagerston, whom, I see, he is to
marry next week—&#8203;an attempt to blackmail Mrs.
Hartsilver, or himself be ruined financially, which
of course would have ended his army career. Members
of the gang, Blenkiron tells me the Commissioner
of Police assures him, were the originators
of those unwholesome rumors which, you remember,
were common talk in clubland.”</p>

<p>“But how could they ruin Preston? What had
he ever done to give the gang an opening?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
“Nothing dishonorable, of course; I don’t believe
he could be dishonorable if he tried. But it seems
that years ago he backed two bills for a brother
officer whom he looked upon as a friend. The fellow
turned out to be a scoundrel; was cashiered, later
became one of the gang’s ‘creatures,’ and actually
faked the bills into bills for much larger amounts.
And those faked bills were, if Preston refused to
help in the plot against Mrs. Hartsilver—&#8203;it had to
do with some compromising letters she had written—&#8203;to
be presented for payment this month. Poor chap!
No wonder he has been looking so dreadfully ill of
late. It would be interesting to know how many
suicides the Agency Gang has been responsible for
directly and indirectly. Since that night at Henley
Preston has always carried a loaded pistol in his
pocket, and he vowed he would shoot that former
brother officer of his dead if ever he met him again.
And he would have done it, too, and have chanced
the consequences.</p>

<p>“As for that robbery of Marietta Stringborg’s
necklace at the ball at the Albert Hall, the whole
thing was a bluff. The pearls were not real, and it
was Stringborg himself who took them from his wife
at supper and slipped them into Miss Hagerston’s
bag. Jessica Mervyn-Robertson had become furious
at Yootha Hagerston’s determination to find out all
about her, furious, too, with Mrs. Hartsilver, and
the others who were making the same attempt—&#8203;she
had heard about these attempts from Stothert, because
Preston, Mrs. Hartsilver and Miss Hagerston
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>had several times consulted the Metropolitan Secret
Agency—&#8203;and she had made up her mind to ruin
them financially and socially, and indeed that, her
first attempt to disgrace Miss Hagerston, might well
have been accomplished.</p>

<p>“Really,” he continued, “there would seem to be
no end to the machinations to which the Agency-Gang
have had recourse within the past few years.
We shall never know one-tenth of the crimes they
committed or tried to commit. Several of the gang’s
members were actually staying with Sir Stephen
Lethbridge at his place in Cumberland, Abbey Hall,
as his guests, when he shot himself. By the way,
I hear that Fobart Robertson has at last been discovered,
living in a garret in Lyons, and that he is
being brought over to give evidence against his wife
and Stapleton and others regarding the secret exportation
of the Chinese drug from Shanghai long
ago. He ought to prove a useful witness.”</p>

<p>And so the clouds which had so darkened Yootha’s
and Cora’s happiness, the happiness also of Preston
and of Johnson, had at last almost rolled away. The
four had arranged to be married towards the end of
the month, and already were busy buying <i lang="fr">trousseaux</i>,
acknowledging letters of congratulation and the receipt
of presents, and attending to the many other
matters which so engross prospective brides and
bridegrooms. George Blenkiron had promised to
act as best man to his life-long friend, Charles Preston,
and the latter had decided to send in his papers
at an early date, for, though an excellent soldier, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>monotonous life of an officer in peace time would, he
knew, bore him to extinction.</p>

<p>Harry Hopford had asked Johnson to allow him
to be his best man, “in return,” as he put it, “for
services rendered, and the way I helped to bring
about your engagement!” Johnson suspected, and
Cora knew, that Hopford himself had been greatly
attracted by “the beautiful widow,” as she was
commonly called; and perhaps had the lad not had
sense enough to realize that for him to hope to marry
Cora when almost his sole source of income consisted
of the salary he was paid by the newspaper to
which he was attached, and the payments he received
from miscellaneous other journals to which
he contributed, was hopeless, he might have felt
tempted to press his own suit.</p>

<p>True, he had once gone so far as to think the
matter over seriously, carefully weighing the pros
and cons, but the decision he had come to was that
Cora did not care for him sufficiently to be likely
to accept him even should he have the audacity to
propose to her. The thought that if he did propose
to her and she accepted him he would, after the
marriage, be in a position to abandon his profession
and live thenceforward on her income, of course,
never entered his mind.</p>

<p>“I pity any woman who marries a journalist or
a literary man,” he said mentally, as he considered
possibilities one night over a cigar. “We writing
folk may have our good points, but I think our
chronic irritability more than outweighs them, to say
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>nothing of our inconstancy where women are concerned,
our ‘sketchiness,’ and our lack of mental
balance. If I were a woman I would any day sooner
marry a lawyer or a stockbroker than a man who
earns his livelihood by his pen. Such people at any
rate give their wives a sporting chance of being able
to live with them in peace, whereas we news seekers
and scribblers—&#8203;—”</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, and smiled as he
mixed himself a brandy and soda. Yet even then
he could not wholly dispel from his imagination the
picture of Cora Hartsilver. Suddenly his telephone
rang, and he unhooked the receiver.</p>

<p>A fire had broken out in Smithfield and was making
rapid headway—&#8203;a big fire—&#8203;steamers hastening
to it from all directions—&#8203;yes, half a column, but a
column if possible—&#8203;yes, not later than midnight—&#8203;—</p>

<p>He picked up his notebook and thrust it into his
pocket, switched off the light and went downstairs.
A taxi was passing as he reached the street, and he
hailed it.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, as he passed swiftly along Oxford
Street, “a journalist’s wife must have a dog’s life!”</p>

<p>Some days later the newspapers contained an interesting
“story,” regarding a theft of diamonds some
years previously in Amsterdam from a well-known
diamond merchant whose place of business had then
been situated in the Kalverstraat. The arrest of
Archie La Planta in London in connection with the
Agency Gang crimes had, it seemed, attracted the
attention of the Amsterdam police, and among the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>people in England with whom they had communicated
was a certain Major Guysburg. Eventually,
the story ran, Major Guysburg had been called upon
to identify two men still residing in Amsterdam, one
of whom, it then transpired, had shared lodgings with
La Planta at the time of the robbery, and had now
turned King’s evidence, while the other had once
been Alphonse Michaud’s secretary. After a good
deal of legal quibbling, Michaud was proved actually
to have stolen stones which he had himself insured,
and for which, after the robbery, he had been paid
his claim in full.</p>

<p>On the night before their wedding—&#8203;for finally
Cora and Johnson and Yootha and Preston had
decided to get married in London on the same day—&#8203;the
two happy couples with their best men, Hopford
and Blenkiron, sat at supper in the grill of the
Piccadilly. Not too near the band played the inevitable
“Dardanella”; around them supper parties
chattered and laughed loudly; waiters carrying
dishes and wine hurried hither and thither as though
their lives depended upon rapidity of action.</p>

<p>Presently the manager approached, a broad smile
on his pleasant face. He came up to Preston.</p>

<p>“At the request of Mr. Hopford,” he said, “I have
just informed six officers of the Devon Regiment,
who are dining in a private room upstairs, that you
and these ladies and gentlemen are dining here; and
on Mr. Hopford’s instructions I have given them
other information.”</p>

<p>His smile widened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
“And the officers present their compliments and
wish to say they hope you and your friends will join
them in their room at your convenience.”</p>

<p>“What are their names?” Preston asked.</p>

<p>The manager told him.</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” Preston exclaimed. “It’s my
dear old C.O., and five of the very best—&#8203;we
were all in France together about the time of
the first attack on Thiepval. I haven’t seen them
since.”</p>

<p>He turned and addressed the manager:</p>

<p>“Will you please say that we accept the kind
invitation, and will be up shortly? Harry, you
rascal, how did you find out about these officers
dining here?”</p>

<p>“Quite by accident, when I was prowling in search
of news this morning. My first idea was to look up
your old C.O. at once. Then I decided it would be
better, because less formal, if I sprang the news on
him to-night, while they were at dinner, that you
were to be married to-morrow, and that we were all
here to-night. I knew they would be glad to see
you again.”</p>

<p>He looked at Yootha.</p>

<p>“Is anything the matter?” he asked, for she was
suddenly looking sad.</p>

<p>“Nothing at all,” she replied with a forced smile,
though her moist eyes belied her words. “I was
thinking of my brothers, both still in Mespot, and
apparently likely to remain there. I have not seen
either for over two years, and to-night I feel a longing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>to have them here. Their presence would complete
my happiness.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t worry about that,” Hopford answered
with twinkling eyes. “News came through to the
office this evening, just as I was leaving, that your
brothers’ regiment has been ordered home, so probably
you will find your brothers awaiting you on
your return to London from your honeymoon unless,”
he smiled mischievously, “they go direct to
Cumberland to stay with your father and your stepmother!”</p>
